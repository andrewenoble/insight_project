0.5002,0.8356,0.0174,0.9648,0.0178,"&gt;One thing that won't work is lecturing her or trying to use logic or arguments, because if her dementia has become bad, she isn't able to understand anymore, she just can't. 

Definitely.  Even if she thinks something that you and family know is completely wrong, let her be.  Let her think that grandpa is still alive (even if he isn't), or that she needs to go clean up the kitchen table (even if it's already been cleaned up).  These thoughts calm her, and if you try to correct her, it can upset her more.  Good luck."

At first it was hard because I felt like I was deceiving him but I've found it actually has a great calming effect.
0.4894,0.8476,0.0115,0.9788,0.0,"Wow this sounds like a terrible situation. It sounds incredibly tough- are you the main person taking care of her?

It's tough to give advice on these sorts of situations specifically but it sounds like you have a good general strategy. Deferring requests or giving them something to do before they go (okay let's go, but first we need to find your coat and shoes) and then letting them become sidetracked and calm down are generally good strategies.

Honestly it just sounds like a bad situation where there was no good way to prepare for the unexpected crap that suddenly happened. If you know anyone else who has experience caring for a loved one, sometimes it helps to call and talk to them and they can help you out.

I could ask you a lot more questions but feel free to chat or PM if you would like to talk about this more.

Hang in there and please take care."

It was an episode of severe paranoia and he was extremely agitated and yelling and pacing back and forth in the middle of the night in the foyer by my front door.  The only thing I could think of saying was, ""They won't come tonight.  I slashed their tires.""

I never knew if validating his delusions was the correct way to go, but it seemed to work.  He responded to me with a, ""Whew, thanks"" and went to bed."

I think this deflection becomes harder to utilize as the disease progresses. "

And my mom is the person who sits with her, makes sure she is clean and fed and takes her medication, etc. My mom gets out of the house once or twice a week for a couple hours for a break and all this happened when I was alone with my grandma. 

&gt;Honestly it just sounds like a bad situation where there was no good way to prepare for the unexpected crap that suddenly happened.

The more I think about it, the more it seems like what you said. It was just a deluge of emotion and the disease and I was totally unprepared to deal with it. Thanks for your suggestion about the coat and shoes. I think I'll try that one next time. "

It just works because it shows you are on their side and you understand they need to do something but it also gives them a chance to calm down and be sidetracked."

0.0221,0.0384,0.9464,0.0443,0.0,"Early onset AD is typically caused by a genetic mutation typically involving amyloid-beta or the enzymes which cleave it or interact with it in some way. From what I remember in my literature searches THC has only been shown to have activity in vitro which should be taken with a grain of salt as nearly everything can interact with amyloid-beta. It is doubtful that THC has any real medicinal use in vivo or in humans for AD. The more promising substances which are readily available are EGCG (in green tea) or curcumin (tumeric), however these natural products have bioavailability/stability issues but have been shown to have some effect in mice models of AD.

I would not be able to care for his needs-he needs professional medical attention and no matter how much I love him, I can't provide the level of care he needs. I know alot of people talk bad about nursing homes and children who put their parents there, but there's more to it than that. The staff where he is absolutely wonderful. They have learned his personality and know how to deal with him. He can be very particular about things. They update me with anything that happens. I see him frequently. He doesn't really know where he is. I imagine no one in a nursing home wants to be there, but objectively, for my and my dad's situation, that is the best place for him and for me too. I don't have as much resentment toward him as I did when he was at home. The home has monitors that keep him from falling, which he was doing quite a bit of when he was home. Please think in terms of what's best for you, your husband and your mother. It's a hard, sad thing to deal with and no choice is going to be easy or fix everything. I'm not out dancing in the street because my dad's in a home. And I do struggle with guilt on occasion, but that's really society's guilt not mine and reject what other people who aren't living my life and taking care of my dad have to say. I wish you the best. And thanks for sharing your story."

0.5004,0.8453,0.0116,0.9761,0.0123,"As someone who works in a dementia facility, I can tell you that I know it's a hard decision, but it's for their (and your) safety. We are designed around the needs of this disease, and have trained people to take care of and deal with residents in different stages of dementia. As they progress, not only can they hurt themselves, but they can get violent with you as well. I get beat on regularly because mood swings just changes who they used to be. And it's better for you, as the family, to not have to witness that. It's hard enough to deal with a parent declining, but when you have to witness all the hard stuff, it adds way more stress.

If you decide to put her in a facility, just make sure you're comfortable with it, and visit her! Even when you think she doesn't know you...it still will brighten her day, I see this first hand. Good luck with your decision!"
0.5486,0.7546,0.0157,0.8713,0.113,"As a caregiver at a facility, this is what we have to do quite often if their memory is such that you know they won't recall later. Think of excuses like someone is borrowing your car right now...or it's too late, or the bus won't be here til tomorrow...etc. try to steer clear of responses that may worry them like the car won't start, or you can't afford to do something...it may be temporary, but it can just change one obsession to another until the moment passes. Good luck!"
0.5001,0.8116,0.0313,0.9372,0.0315,"Another thing we are taught is to deflect their questions. If they wanna go home, try to get them on the subject of what they love about home, or happy memories they have there. Don't respond to their requests, just distract them with something that can calm them. "
0.2561,0.4435,0.4789,0.5122,0.0,"Your situation sounds a lot like mine did. My father in law started showing symptoms a little earlier, he is 69 now. Your dad seems to be showing the same signs that my FIL was showing early on. I don't know if it's my personal situation taking here, but I think that starting the meds as early as possible is a good idea. Nothing can stop the progression, but there are medications that can slow it down. The thing that I have been told in the past, and that I have definitely noticed myself, is that if you start the medicine you need to stay on it. Sometimes the person will think that the medicine isn't doing anything because you will continue to see symptoms, but if you stop the meds you will notice how much they were helping. In my FIL's case, when he was taken off of the medication he really went downhill. And you can't get that time back by going back on the meds. 
Obviously I'm no professional but my experience comes from being a caregiver and reading as much as I can on Alzheimer's.
If it were my father I would encourage him to see a doctor ASAP, because you will not get that time back. Good luck to you and your family."
0.5383,0.7732,0.0153,0.8928,0.0919,"First of all, don't be sad if it comes to having to break your promise to her, know you did your best for as long as possible, but don't break yourself in the process of trying to fix the unfixable. I'm 26 and dealing with a dad in the early stages, so the heavy stuff has yet to come, but I've already gone through a lot of emotions trying to come to terms with all the aspects of this situation. My thoughts are if you can be a more loving, caring child to your parent when she's in a home, then it's more than okay to do so. My grandmother is in a facility because of her alzheimers and it takes a lot of pressure off my father for the time being, until his disease starts to get the better of him. "

0.5011,0.8419,0.0128,0.9721,0.0151,"I wish I could help you, but I am struggling with this myself. It is so hard. My dad, a gentle man, tried to punch me several times this week. He tried to throw me out. He also told me he loved me and misses me. He is suffering, and was just put on hospice care. I went to visit him this week (I live out of the country) thinking it would be the end as he had stopped eating altogether.  Instead, I gave him some of his favorite foods and he is now eating like a horse. So, he lives on and I wonder if I should be ecstatic or depressed about it. 

I am afraid there are no answers - you just have to survive it somehow. "

0.7446,0.4167,0.0148,0.4811,0.5041,"My dad is 65 and was diagnosed earlier last year. I would damn the insurance and do the meds, the earlier he starts, the better is what I've gotten from my dad's doctor. Insurance is important, but it's really a hard situation to make a decision about, because you lose time with him the later he starts his medications.

I would try your best to get as much done in the first year as possible, power of attorney (probably your mom in this case), his wants for when his condition needs 24 hr care, etc. I am still struggling to get answers from my dad to get these things done for him because he, like your dad, still thinks he doesn't really have a problem.

0.0374,0.0,0.9574,0.0,0.0374,"HappyHooker84 raises many good points; especially the research. To increase your accuracy, this is more specifically an unclear type of dementia. Alzheimer's can only be diagnosed post-mortem but is still classified as a type of dementia.

There is certainly something to be said for cognitive therapy; much of my work focuses on cognitive therapy and there are definite benefits to it. Increasing cognitive stimulation can decrease the progression of the symptoms; similar to the medications. The treatments involve a wide variety of things including physical exercise, performing ""new"" tasks, increasing social activity and cognitive exercises (crossword puzzles, word searches, sudoku, etc.); the list I just provided is in order of effectiveness. I want to let you know these are treatments and not cures, same as the medications and I encourage you to do your own research. Memory loss is a symptom and can be related to a variety of things but going to a medical professional would be the first step. We can talk about this all we want but until a professional does some form of evaluation this can only really remain unclear.

0.2038,0.3337,0.6035,0.3853,0.0111,"Yes I agree with playing music from her youth. Dementia and Alzheimer's is in effect the stripping away of the more short term memories. My grandmother has dementia also. The brain works backwards in effect and causes her to eventually forget the more recent things and remember her earlier memories as a child and young adult. We played my grandmother music from her youth and she was dancing in her chair, clapping along and knew a lot of the words. The earliest memories will be the last to go in this disease and so things from this time are more likely to spark her interest or cause her to remember things and find enjoyment and pleasure. Hope this helps!"

Currently he has visual and spacial problems and spelling and maths are affected greatly as well as trouble finding the right words. His intelligence is still intact but he has a lot more trouble with computers now which was a large part of his job prior to diagnosis. 
I am sorry for your loss. I hope at least she was happy in herself and comfortable. My grandmother has dementia and is now in a home however I find it a help to see her happy and laughing more than ever - music is a fuel for her happiness I have found. "

A lot of this poem stems from the memories I made at a family get-together the last time I saw him, when he was still himself, pretty much right after his wife figured out what was happening.

I'm glad you liked the poem :) The fact that it resonates with anyone but me is pretty powerful!"

It's too deep for them. They are reactionary and don't have thought processes to work thru things they experience. Most often if things trigger memories, they act out or get confused, but it's hard to tell what's going on in their minds. 

It's very well possible that these are steps that lead up to the caliber of dementia I see on a day to day basis."

Even when they don't recognize you, it still makes a difference. Would your grandmother, in her right mind, allow you to die alone? I am not trying to be judgmental...but i just see a lot of people who's family figures that since they can't remember, that it won't make a difference to be visited.

Visit them and talk about things they do remember. Talk about their childhood...sing a song they would remember, bring a photo, etc. it's common for dementia to remember their early years and not their later ones, so she may not remember you, but other things will still be a good stimulant for her."

Your reply to latsyrcami leads me to believe that you may not have a great relationship with her, but there mere fact that you're considering visiting tells me you're probably, generally, a good person. As such, good people tend to have regrets about not visiting dying loved ones when they had the chance. Just prepare yourself for what's likely to happen. There may be confrontation, there may be confusion or anger. If that happens, don't let those things tarnish this ""last visit"" with your grandmother. It's not her causing these problems, it's the disease. Good luck this weekend, I hope all goes well.

Our relationship prior to her diagnosis wasn't good, you're right. There was no animosity but we were indifferent to each other at best. That's part of the reason why I've been hesitant to see her. My last visit with her was better than probably the last 10 I've had with her. But even if she reacts badly, even if she gets angry I know I went, I tried to be there with her and that's all I can do. Thanks."

Alzheimer's is a long slow progression, traditionally hitting people that are older, and it's MANY years of a slow decline unless another health problem comes up. But there's also dementia related to brain conditions (tumor, etc) or cancers, or other diseases. 

Also forgetfulness and occasional odd behavior is also part of getting older. It doesn't always mean the worst. You should start documenting when/what his odd behaviors are. This way if the time comes to consult a dr, you have some examples to back you up. Also, ask other people that may see him when you don't, to tell you about concerning behavior. My grandfather is starting to show signs, and a big one is his driving and how his reasoning skills are getting kinda wonky. 

I hope you get some answers, but don't freak out yet. If you have specific questions, feel free to ask, but I primarily work with dementia in the later stages, so the diagnosing is not something I'm familiar with. Also, I'm only a CNA, but I've worked in this field for a couple years."

As to your first question: Does he have any upcoming checkups since he has had those recent troubles? It might be possible to call ahead and try to get the doc to administer a few additional tests or to watch out. Otherwise, it can be really difficult to get a person to get diagnosed but you might try to go through a person or use examples to explain it to him that he will find very credible.

Your second question depends entirely on the answer to your first question- if he is having problems stemming from his TGA incident or some other health problem that can be resolved, things could work out with treatment. It's also possible, as I mentioned, that he isn't sick but is just slowing down a bit as he gets older.

I suspect that these caregiver guides are not research based, and may be wrong. Now a television playing in the background might be a distraction, but I hypothesize that personal interaction may be stimulating some of the sub cortical brain structures that are involved in eating.

If they are eating and have food in their mouth (prone to pocketing or what have you) and you're trying to speak with them, or they're distracted by your presence they are much more likely to choke, aspirate, etc.

Some ideas:
1.  Give her something to do to occupy / distract her, like folding laundry or similar-sized washcloths - keep the tasks simple and absorbing - try to match her ability so she doesn't get bored or frustrated (she can re-fold things after she's done if she likes that particular task)
2.  ""Fall-proof"" the house.  Get rid of any throw rugs; tape down edges of any partial carpets, remove clutter, make sure there aren't any cables or cords in the way of anything, make sure the hallways and rooms are well-lit (including at night with night lights).  Get grab bars in the bathroom for use with the toilet / bathtub.
3.  Make sure she always wears well-fitting, snug shoes with a good grip on the bottom -- along with clothing that is flexible and non-restrictive but that doesn't get in the way - like sweatpants and T-shirts
4.  Take her out for walks outside together, if possible, near the house - even walk around the perimeter of the house"

They are a little pricey, but they can help prevent broken hips and bruising. Your grandmother may also refuse to wear them. The nice thing about them is that there are pant styles and underpant styles, so if she is refusing to wear them, you could always hide the underpant ones in a pair of her pants (this is assuming that you help her dress). 


There is not much you can do with the people that wander. Sometimes giving them things to do is very helpful, but other times there is nothing you can do to calm them down. Just have patience. Remember that they can sense your frustrations, so if you get a little too frustrated, leave the room and take a few minutes for yourself, as long as she is safe. "

As mentioned by another commenter, knowing what kind of dementia is pretty important, so my next thoughts revolve around how to find out.

My mom had alzheimer's.  She was also proud, not at all inclined to acknowledge what was happening.

There were 2 or 3 other family members besides myself who were involved, we all played a part in eventually getting her situation in hand.

Do you have other family members, or friends who can strategize with you?  Also, one or another of those people may be more adept at talking to your dad in a way that goes a little better at letting him drop his defenses, even if only a little bit.

You ask if there are different types - [Here's a graphic](http://www.thehealthsteer.com/dementia-global-pandemic-infographic/) that includes a brief description of the main types.  What comes next as to progression, what will be forgotten, etc., is highly dependent on the type of dementia he has.

If you can get him to sign a release with the Drs allowing them to discuss his diagnosis with you or some other family member, that would be ideal.

Hope some of this helps, reply any time if you get more information or have more questions - Good luck!"

So first off I'm so sorry. My dads 60 (I'm 21) and he is in the final stages of dementia currently. It is so hard hearing a diagnosis, and not knowing what it really means.

Anyhow, dementia varies greatly depending on the type, person, age, etc. Sadly, usually the earlier a person gets it, the more aggressive it is.

My dad ran a multi-million dollar business up until 5 years ago when he was diagnosed. The one piece of advice I have is that you need to pay attention to his decisions a bit more. We found out my dad made some poor purchases and lost the businesses a significant amount of money. It is easy to ignore, but since he is in control of a major company it is something that needs to be considered.

Once again, I'm sorry. I know it's hard and can make you feel so ill equipped. If you have any questions- let me know. We have gone through a lot over the years and any info I can pass on I gladly will!"

Our family is naturally sort of shy as well, and it's going to be hard to talk about it.  But we have to.

Your business advice is prescient, now that you mention this, my father made a terrible purchase a few weeks back. He ordered the incorrect size of a custom order of louvers and this cost our company around $4500. Well it's not a great mistake but I'm realizing now that it may have been due to this.

Yes, he will.  We can't predict when that will be and neither can his doctors, really.  It's a very case by case basis.

Maybe.  Maybe not.  Again this is  a case by case basis.
 
&gt;Will he need a care taker? 

Probably. But again, when exactly that point comes isn't something we can predict.

&gt;How long before he is gone? 

Early onset dementia is often very aggressive.  There might not be a whole lot of time before he is unable to care for himself.  You should be worrying about this now.  

But he might be physically around for a very long time, if he doesn't have or develop other outstanding health conditions

There are things you need to do more immediately.  Take steps to ensure the success of the family business without him in the picture.  Make sure you, or someone else trustworthy are his power of attorney because you will need it.  

But lots of it, is really a wait and see game.  There are medications that can help slow the process down.  It's a constantly changing battle when you're the primary care taker.  If you're unsure what things to move into your name right now speak to his doctor about what needs to be done more immediately, or at least ask him to refer to you to someone who can help you make those decisions."

It's important to find out what sort of dementia, what is *causing* the dementia. The first thing the doctors did was a brain scan looking for damaged tissues that would be a sign of stroke. When they didn't find any structural damage, they assumed Alzheimer's was the culprit but after he died they realized his dementia had been caused by a leaky aortic valved which led to CHS congestive heart failure and told us that a persistent lack of oxygen to the brain had caused his dementia - a direct result of the untreated heart trouble.

For him, it progressed blindingly fast. Within a year of the first hint of trouble, he was no longer able to manage his life, pay bills, do any of the maintenance tasks required. 

You can never be too prepared. Get as much info as you can from his doctors and try to picture what to do when he can no longer be left safely alone anymore.

This situation happens often with people that have dementia. She might be able to recognize you over the phone, but not in person. In person she has visual cues that might not be matching what she remembers. She might remember you as a young girl and not the individual that you are today. So when she sees you instead of seeing her granddaughter, she sees a strange woman in her house and comes to conclusions that can seem hurtful. Perhaps when she sees you with your Dad this is an additional visual cue that triggers more of an understanding that you are someone important to her (though she still might not fully recognize you). The important thing to remember is that it is not truly her that is getting angry at you, but the disease that is causing her to become confused, and perhaps frightened, which causes her behavior.

I'm a mom, my kid is 24 - As a mom, I'd say your mom would love it if you stay in touch as much as you can, and she probably wouldn't want you to leave school, she'd want to see you getting ahead in your life as much as possible while she's still able.

Skype, smartphone texts &amp; pics, phone calls, emails - There are lots of ways to let her know you're thinking of her, to include her in your life.  Ask her how she's feeling, tell her you're scared and you know she must be scared too, you can comfort each other.  Ask her everything you can think of about her life before you were born, so you'll know.

The hardest step may be the first - Kind of sounds like there hasn't been much talking about it, just plain talk, if so just opening the subject could be super challenging.  

But take my advice, if it fits - 

Don't ""wait for the right moment"", 

Don't hold back because ""I haven't figured out the right words"" - 

Any words are the right words, every moment is the right moment - It may start out all awkward, but that part is over with in a flash, merely an instant of discomfort, with a huge payoff in all the good that you'll have with her.

She thinks that she is doing all the cooking, cleaning, running errands, but in reality she hasn't been able to do any of that for years.  She can no longer follow a conversation.

I actually am thankful that it took this long to really affect him because we we're able to prepare ourselves with the possibilities.

offers memory care. Find a good one that has a good reputation and begin to live your life as you wish. Trust me when I tell you that these communities are wonderful.

But like someone else who posted below, we would also have to stand by and coach her.

 Maybe something that is timed and won't open until it is the appropriate time to take them would be enough, I mean it is not like we can integrate all the medication into one super pill that is somehow easy to swallow!

I have suggested several times to get a caregiver but they are still in denial on how much work this is.


Second realize that as the disease progresses, your grandma will no longer be the person you grew up with. Meaning that at times she will not remember or understand what you are telling her. Again this is happening with my uncle and my parents. They insist on explaining to him logically why he shouldn't drive at night (for example) and my uncle either doesn't remember or hasn't yet realized his own limitations and then gets lost.

If you can find a support group for caretakers of people with dementia in your area, that can be immensely helpful.

It is incredibly difficult to remain calm and positive at all times, so forgive yourself if you struggle or act in a way that you wish you hadn't. As the disease progresses, communication is more difficult, but keep in mind that the person is left with the feeling of the conversation, even if they can't fully comprehend the words or express themselves.

I agree it sounds that in this case it is potentially largely due to understaffing which whilst a reason- it's not an excuse. 

I'm from UK so don't have much knowledge of US social care, but over here we have a quality monitoring organisation called CQC (Care Quality Commission). These people go out into care homes, both announced and unannounced, and carry out checks on the home, giving them a rating for the public to view. If a home isn't complying with regulations (and this can include factors such as institutionalised care) CQC has the authority to enforce strict action plans, or even suspend the home. 

I would suggest contacting the equivalent of CQC where you live and tell them you are concerned that people living there are not receiving an acceptable standard of care. You can do this anonymously so no need to worry about your manager finding out it was you. Worst comes to worst- the home is found to be mistreating people and they are helped to make it right again.

The days I thought were the hardest two years ago pale in comparison to now. Your father's laugh might be out of place but try to enjoy it. My father lost his ability to smile, laugh, or even cry. He can still talk but his emotions are mostly grunts and he is in a constant blank stare. There is no telling what else he will lose as the disease progresses. 

Start checking with nursing homes now because some facilities will have wait lists of 2 years or more. Men are also harder to place at times. They are ridiculously expensive so it is never too early to get his finances together. 

Find a support network. This can be friends, family, or a local caregiver support group, whatever. Please talk to people about what is happening. My mother was the primary caregiver and until recently she has kept my father's condition a secret. How she lasted is beyond me. Personally, I had a hard time finding people who could relate.

Lots of times I have to call her by her first name because she thinks she has two kids, not three, and when I call her mom it upsets her. I've managed to emotionally separate the two women (if that makes sense).  It makes it easier for me to deal with her and take care of her. I'm able to make decisions about her care easier when I remove the emotion. For example, she needs a tooth fixed. Dentist wants to crown it.  I told them to pull it.

2. Is his mouth really dry? If so, try something like biotene or another product intended for xerostomia. Is his tongue really red, almost pink? Cracked? Can you see ropey spit in his mouth? 
3. Can he smell the food being prepared? If not, try and make smell happen before taste happens. Prime the system.
4. Does the food look appealing, or is the meal time setting somewhat social and enjoyable?
5. Test the following: sweet, sour, cold, hot, textures. See if there is anything at all that makes a difference. For example, ice cream (cold and sweet), gingerale (carbonated and sweet), lemon, etc.

I can't stress the smell thing enough (3). It may sound strange, but priming is a real thing, and it's often a good thing to use with people with dementia.

If your mom wants nothing to do with the man she divorced, how can she expect you to? To me, that seems very unfair. 

These situations are so much more complicated than one can state in six paragraphs, but based on what you've written (that he was an abusive father, that you're estranged) I would say that you do not have any obligation to take care of him. That said, if your conscience tells you that you must do something, then do something. Your involvement can be as little or as much as you'd like it to be.

It doesn't sound like your father is going to be able to go home, which is probably a blessing for you. Since he is mentally unstable, it is better for him to live in a facility than at home where he can be a danger to others. If you have the option of putting him in a nursing home and having the state pay for it, that sounds like a pretty good solution--again, I'm not sure what your circumstances are.

The bottom line is that you are young, you're on your way to building a good life. It doesn't sound like your father took stellar care of you when you were growing up, and I would say you shouldn't feel obligated to be there for him now. Do what you can so your heart and mind are at peace, but don't give up more than you want to. Good luck, I wish you the best.

If it had the same effect (or some other med, whatever the dr. recommends) on your dad, it might be a ""kill 2 birds with 1 stone"" situation - He could potentially go out to these programs, get part of his day filled so there'd be less time at home for getting bored.

My brother has loads of alcohol abuse health issues including some form of demintia. He's been in the hospital 3 times this year and lives 400 miles away.

In OP's case this might not be a bad way to start to get the dementia diagnosed, get the primary caregiver to recognize that there is a medical problem and not just the grandmother being difficult, and hopefully to get some additional support.

If this doesn't work the next step would be a medical and general power of attorney (or local equivalent) that would allow OP to manage care. "

I'm very sorry about your grandmother. 

If religion is a point of contention with your family, it's best not to discuss it. Your father is in the process of losing a parent, which isn't easy at any age. If the thought of an afterlife helps him come to terms with everything that's going on, that's okay. Just because you support him in this doesn't mean you're lessening your values - it's exactly as it sounds: you're supporting your family member in a way that helps them.

This isn't to say your beliefs aren't important! I'm a crazy mish mash of Buddhist and pagan (I don't even know, lol), but my mother is just Christian and it helps her to think there's an afterlife when it comes to my father. Just nod and smile, appreciate it for what it is - someone using religion to find a way to deal with things.

One of the big problems I see with Alzheimer's is that it's hard to know how much the person understands about his own condition, or if he is even aware that he is ill. All we can do is try our best to get ""in the moment"" with them and try to see the world the way they see it, which, from what I can tell, can change from minute to minute as their attention is buffeted about by occurrences great and small. So it's easy for them to misinterpret what's going on. But the misinterpretation may not last very long because the next thing will happen and the world will change again.

Still, I can understand how heartbreaking it must be to have someone you love so much feel bad and apologize for something they didn't actually do. Your dad may have thought for a moment that you were mad at him for his crown coming out, but I'm sure that your overall care and continued reassurances soothed things over at the emotional level, which I think has a more lasting effect than whatever he thought happened.

It's heartbreaking to start treating someone who's been your rock like a child, but it helps to understand that this type of treatment is only carried out in the practical sense. I don't think of my husband as a child — I think of him as the person he's always been — I just arrange things to keep him as safe, healthy, and happy as I can. I try to get into his world as best I can.

0.4477,0.7754,0.0987,0.8954,0.0,"Honestly, there is no need to receive a more specific diagnosis.  The only thing it would probably do is give you and your family peace of mind.  The attending physician at the facility you're looking at, may request blood draws (labs) to determine what her levels of various things are at to correctly treat her.  It's probably not a good idea to confuse your mother anymore than necessary with all the extra tests.  If the facility is willing to admit her without the extra dx, than don't worry about getting it.  

Knowing when the right time to move into a facility is hard.  Whenever you feel it's right, it's right.  There's no 'perfect' time.  Sounds like she needs a locked facility so she can roam as she pleases yet still staying safe.  The employees at the facility are specifically trained so they'll know how to redirect these hallucinations.  ""I haven't eaten all day"" is a common comment in people with dementia.  They don't remember they've eaten, yet you as the caregiver knows she ate great at her last meal.  She may be hungry when she says something like this, so it's okay to feed a small snack to hold her her until the next meal.

Hope that helps :)

There's not one answer for everyone as people react differently when they learn of their condition. However, may I suggest that gentle, agreeable persuasion may be a good approach. But don't be in a hurry. There's little that can be done for people living with Alzheimer's and dementia except to be supportive of them. Emotional support being the most important.

It really isn't critical that your dad is officially diagnosed right now. What's important is that he feels your support and is made to feel safe as his world begins to change. His fears and doubts will need to be addressed sympathetically and he'll benefit greatly from your positive, yet understanding support. 

Telling him that he's wrong or mistaken won't help him. In fact, it may even cause him more distress. The best you can do is to accept his misperceptions and allow him to believe whatever it is that he says he believes. If he doesn't get what you're saying, ask him what he thinks you're saying and accept that as the right explanation.

You, or someone, will eventually need to be more involved in his life in order to prevent any serious accident or injury. I hate to say it, but the time will come when he won't be safe to be left alone. He will need close care and attention.

We are creating a pin that will allow strangers to know that the person wearing it has Alzheimer’s, while at the same time sparing that person from having to be reminded of it all the time.
This pin also has the potential to save lives. Say a person wearing the pin was walking by himself. In this case a stranger wouldn't have to hesitate and could notify authorities right away and reunite that person with their family.
The logo is bold and noticeable but it is abstract enough that the person wearing it won't feel like they have a sign on them.

The feelings of sluggishness/poor memory you're having are worth some discussion with your doctor, even outside of their possible relationship to your other health concerns.

The test would probably just be a serious of questions similar to the SAGE test - not anything invasive.

It would be extremely rare to have dementia at your age, though not completely impossible. But mild cognitive impairment due to medications, depression, stress, etc. is much more likely.

Don't be so hard on yourself.  Dementia is a disease that you have absolutely zero control over.  It is wonderful that you want to be there for your Nana and you should be - but only to the point where it does not destroy your life.  You have a right to live also.  Unless you're the primary caregiver, limit your interaction with her.  Yes, as you stated she was there for you through difficult times for you and you seem to realize and appreciate that which is a lot more than many people would do.  However, that was in the past.  Life is in the present and your life counts just as much as everyone else's and that includes Nana's.

I can tell you that in the US the GP only gives a simple in-office non-written memory test which isn't going to result in anyone's job loss. If a patient does poorly enough on the test the GP will refer the patient to a specialist for further testing. Unless things are very different where you live, you might want to urge your mum to at least confide in her GP and let her/him suggest how to proceed.

Consult your car manual and take a look into the fuse box under the dashboard. The ECU (engine control unit) fuse is often marked with a stylized engine with a flash in it. Remove it and the car won't start because no gas gets injected. The starter will still work, so you can tell him about some ""trouble"" with the engine. Hide the fuse it in the ashtray or your wallet so you can ""repair"" it easily. Tell me what car he drives (Model, engine, year), and i will look it up for you which fuse to remove. 
I hope he does not drive a diesel, because i'm not 100% sure if this method works with diesels too."

I would try to remove one of the marked fuses.
Drive to a remote area (big parking lot), start the engine and remove one fuse (fuse 22 or 26) at a time. If the engine dies, that's the fuse to remove.
Another way is to shut down the engine, remove fuse 21 or 25 and try to start the engine. As long the fuse diagram is somewhat logical, the engine should not start with any of these fuses removed.

If you are afraid of doing it yourself, go to any autoshop or car guy and ask for help.

When my mother was diagnosed, my aunt (mom's sister) told me she didn't have Alzheimer's, that my mom just didn't feel needed anymore. I was 18! I don't think there was a time in my life I needed her more.  She also criticized my dad's care of my mother, which was idiotic as no one could have loved or cared for my mother more or better than he did.

My dad, sister and I clung to one another for support and eventually the criticisms and denials went away as the symptoms became more apparent. I suspect that will happen in your situation as well. My advice would be to ignore or politely request that they visit more or act as caregivers themselves. Hopefully time will heal this wound in your family. Best of luck."
0.3952,0.6846,0.1999,0.7905,0.0,"A common symptom for people with dementia is sometimes referred to as sundowners syndrome. This is the phenomenon where people with dementia often become more symptomatic in the evenings and at night. Maybe your relative is getting more confused in the evenings and as a result is feeling more uncertain and afraid. It is probably not a bad thing that there is someone with her in the evenings, even though she wishes it wasn't necessary. If she is getting lost sometimes that is a big concern since many people with dementia will wander and get lost which can be very dangerous. There are bracelets that you can buy that have a number to call if someone finds her while she is lost/wandering so that help can be dispatched right away. I'm guessing that in general having people who care about her checking in and being with her will help her feel more reassured and safe, but everyone is different so you might try having a conversation with her about what would make her feel more safe, if you haven't already. I'm not sure if this is helpful info, but I figured I'd share just in case. It's super hard to care for a relative with dementia, and she is lucky to have you helping her. "

I think Alzheimer's is harder on the caretakers than the patient, since the patient becomes less and less cognizant of what is happening to them while the caretakers watch the changes become more and more debilitating. I've recommended this book on many threads in this subreddit, but in case you missed it, have a look at [The 36-hour Day](http://www.amazon.com/36-Hour-Day-fifth-Alzheimer-Dementias/dp/1421402807/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412354828&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=36+hour+day).

Keep in mind at all times that your mum simply *cannot do* things she used to do, so avoid saying things like, ""Don't you remember...,"" because she *can't*. Just repeat things as though it's for the first time, because for her it is. It's heartbreaking and frustrating at first, but you get into the rhythm of it and settle into a new way of communicating with your ""new"" mum. If people correct her, she will start to withdraw.

You will start to feel like you're treating her like a child, and in some ways you are, but it's just to keep her safe and as healthy as possible. It's difficult to treat her like a child while thinking of her as the person she always was, but you can do it, and I believe that on some level she will appreciate it.

I wish you courage and patience. And please, as peace_core says, vent all you want. The alz.org site has message boards, too. "
0.3888,0.6734,0.2154,0.7776,0.0,"I completed a social work internship working with dementia patients and helping family members with situations just like this one. One thing to keep in mind with your grandmother is that dementia attacks the brain, so what sounds logical to you may be immensely confusing for her. I can tell that you're being very gentle and empathetic with her which is great! 

I usually found with patients who had recently lost a spouse, redirection was key. It is difficult on family members to 'lie' to their loved ones especially on things as important as this, but by making little white lies you can make your grandmother's moment to moment experience so much better. Rather than replying directly when she asks about your grandfather, perhaps you could say something like, 'I'm not sure where he is right now,' (which is partially true) and then redirect to something more positive. Talking about older memories, recounting how the two of them met, or asking her about topics she still is good at discussing are always good. Also tactile activities may spur her memories and give her a feeling of accomplishment and self worth--laundry or painting are both good tactile options.


I am so sorry for your loss. This disease is most awful to the families who have to watch it. Feel free to pm me anytime if you need an ear or to bounce ideas- I have a lot of experience with this both personally and professionally."

Things we would usually tell them would include: ""they're at the store right now""/""ran an errand""/""at school""/""I don't know where he is right now"", and then redirect with another activity. 

Perhaps she will benefit from the scrapbook, you never know until you try. If it seems to continue to cause distress I would switch to redirection techniques. 

Also, sometimes I would remind the person of the passing of their loved one and other times I would redirect. It doesn't always have to be redirect or always remind. "

Inevitably people important to the residents would pass away.  Most residents would have no recollection of the deaths to only a vague remembrance.

One of the only blessings of the disease was that my relative first became fuzzy on the details of the earlier deaths of their spouse and child and then seemed to forget completely.  

Like others have suggested, I advocate redirecting.  Your grandmother lacks the capacity to remember and understand.  Telling her the truth over and over when she can't remember is just confusing her.  

For positive experiences like a wedding she attends or the birth of a great-grandchild a scrapbook isn't a horrible idea.  But there's no reason to try and have your grandma remember the negative things in life anymore.

I would just say ask her how she's doing, let her talk about it, let her be sad, let her be unhappy. It's a horrible situation, and causes so much suffering. I think the best thing you can do is just talk about it with her. If she mentions it, know that she is wanting to talk about it and engage in conversation. It's a very unpleasant subject, especially when you're talking about symptoms that can seem humorous (i.e. my grandma tried calling my aunt on a banana), but know that it's a heartbreaking thing to see someone who previously was whip smart and feisty as hell reduced to a child-like state.

After some experimentation, I came to the conclusion that the most important criterion for me to establish was whether a given chemical stimulated me or made me tired, brain fogged, etc.

Simplest Noots are Caffeine (coffee) + L-Theanine.  Caffeine stimulates, Theanine is an anxiolytic.

Next step I tried was Acetyl L-Carnitine (ALCAR) and Choline (eggs)  - this forms AcetylCholine, a very important neurochemical.

Thereafter I started to experiment with the Racetams (peptides), and other stims like Modafinil, which worked for me. I tried weed once or twice in my early life and hated the effects.  have not tried mushrooms either.
I smoked for many years, so know how strong of a stim nicotine can be.  I quit smoking when i retired, but still use a 7mg patch on my upper arm if I need to really focus and concentrate.

The medical community does not have much to offer all round, except in my case, Modafinil.  Most of the other stuff I take is OTC.

The longer one waits, the less effect things like this have.  I wish I had started five years earlier, I might still have a job.

Which resulted in her being mildly but increasingly distressed about why it was on and how she could get it off and so distracted by that, she spent her entire day trying to puzzle out why she had it on and what she could use to get it off. But, that worked over a couple of days for her to get over the massive nose infection.

There is also a variation called the ""MCT diet"" which allows more carbs...but you have to supplement with MCT oil and/or coconut oil.

And there is a prescription medical food called Axona, specifically for Alzheimer's, that is based on these diets....I think it was expensive compared to MCT or virgin coconut oil.

In the last 6 months she had deteriorated quite badly and can’t go to the day care any more so my dad has a care aid come to the house Monday and Wednesday for 5 hours. 

Two or three years ago she was wondering out of the house and at one point put the wooden cutting board on the stove top and turned it on high. Now she wouldn’t even be able to find the dial on the stove to turn it on. Taking her clothes off was a big thing that she did for a while too. It’s lucky (maybe not for my dad) that we are able to have him be with her full time.

His neurologist said that he should limit wine to 8 ounces per day because alcohol makes memory loss worse. At first I tried to get my husband to self-limit his intake. Every morning I would fill a wine bottle to the top from a boxed wine (hey, Bota Box chardonnay is pretty good). I'd point out to him that the bottle was full and that he should drink only about a third of it. When he drank way more, he'd swear the bottle was only half full to begin with. Sigh!

memantine (Namenda) is approved by the FDA for treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer’s.

Memantine is prescribed to improve memory, attention, reason, language and the ability to perform simple tasks. It can be used alone or with other Alzheimer’s disease treatments. There is some evidence that individuals with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s who are taking a cholinesterase inhibitor might benefit by also taking memantine. Donepezil (Aricept) is the only cholinesterase inhibitor approved to treat all stages of Alzheimer’s disease, including moderate to severe.

Memantine:

    Regulates the activity of glutamate, a different messenger chemical involved in learning and memory.
    Delays worsening of symptoms for some people temporarily. Many experts consider its benefits similar to those of cholinesterase inhibitors.

Im a Pharmacology graduate student studying Alzheimer's disease currently. Allow me to try and clear up the issue! low melatonin levels cause sleep disturbances which can certainly negatively affect the lives of alzheimer's patients, but these low levels are not thought to be causing the disease.

On the other hand, high blood pressure and other issue related to your heart-health are known risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, which are thought to be involved in the actual development and exacerbation of the disease.

So all-in-all, low melatonin levels are not great, but the benefits of lowering blood pressure FAR outweigh the negatives. Especially since melatonin is very easily replaced by supplement in the diet.

Unfortunately, you are misguided in your understanding of how the medical cost for demented patients work. The vast, vast majority of that money is spent on long-term care in hospitals and even more-so on hospice/ elderly care homes. Certainly these organizations are making money off these people, but you have to be out of your damn mind if you think that means that pharmaceutical companies, researchers and doctors by the thousands are not working their asses off to find effective treatments for the diseases every day.

Its not possible for a definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's to be given pre-mortem, so your doctor will likely use a number of tests to determine which of the three is most likely. 

What I can tell you however, is that there is no treatment for any of the three diseases. There are some drugs and lifestyle changes you can make which make slow the progression of symptoms, but nothing exists currently that can alter the course of the diseases themselves. 

I have thought about this a lot after watching my grandparent's progression through the diseases, and considered the fact that my parents and one day I myself may get the disease... It's pretty fucked up to say this, but it's only going to get worse. There are good days and bad days, but my own personal opinion is that in your situation I would utilize these times of relatively lucidity. I would go on long vacations together, etc... share the time you have together now.

I've been working in human services for a couple decades now and I've been called some pretty hilarious things.  I've been in some terrible situations too, and I learned over time to just let it bounce off.  It is tough, so use little tricks to make it easier.
Another trick is to not let yourself feel relief when the job goes easy.  It is MUCH easier to disconnect from a good situation than from a bad one until you get the hang of it.
Finally, write down some of the really awful things she says, and later, with a trusted person, read them.  You will get a bit of sympathy at worst and a huge laugh at best.

This is where the selflessness comes in. I have dealt with my husband's illness by focusing completely on him and putting myself on hold. Even when I need a break — to take a walk, to see friends, to get a manicure — my mindset is that I'm doing this to relieve the stress, to keep myself healthy for him. If he forgets me, it won't be that I'm forgotten; it will be that he deeply loved and appreciated me when he was able to, but that he just can't anymore. If I don't grow old with him, well, life goes on and I'll grow old with whomever is left in my life. People do it all the time.

Honestly, when my husband has a serious lapse — when he doesn't remember that he spent the prior week in the hospital — it makes my heart well up with tenderness for him and draws me to hug him for a long time. When, for the hundredth time, he accuses our nephew of stealing the silver, I validate whatever it was that brought him to say such things — not ""No, he didn't steal the silver,"" but ""Well, he was always an ornery one, wasn't he?""

I think though that it's up to my dad to discuss these things and I will just keep watch on my side and privately keep a track in case it gets useful. Also I will be more attentive to my grandpa every time I see him. It's tough though because my dad is probably the one the most vigilant and lucid about this possibility but as I said he lives abroad right now...

It's hard though because she is on a bunch of drugs and they could also have these effects so we should also not yell fire, but it's been a while that she hasn't been able to remember dates and things going on in people's lives, so in retrospect it seems more worrying now."

You're right that she needs help, but I presume she is legally competent?  My advice would be to have the family talk to a lawyer who specializes in elder care.  He/she will be able to explain the legalities of the situation, including power of attorney or even a guardianship. Best $250.00 you'll spend. It sounds like you need to get her out of your bf's brothers place.  Can you convince him to kick her out?  It's in his interest too.

Take pictures of the cut on her face.  If need be, call an ambulance if the wound worsens or if she becomes unmanageable.  That will force the issue and will result in a report (if she manages to decline a trip to the hospital). The legal situation will be helped if there is a diagnosis from a qualified professional.
If someone doesn't want help, they can make it very hard on the family trying to help them. 

Sadly her condition will likely worsen.  You have to keep her safe and be ready to act in her interest when the opportunity presents itself."

I am an only child and my father died almost 10 years ago. 

There are a couple of drugs on the market that might slow the progress. Arisept and Nminda. (I am  not sure if those are the correct spellings.)  My mother has been on these for a few years. Her progress seemed slow for the first 3 years the past year she seemed to progress more quickly. 

I figured out my mom had some sort of dementia while I was pregnant with my twins 3 years ago. It was very hard to get a long with her. She argued about everything. Two summers ago I got her to agree to give me power of attorney both financial and medical. You should get those done as soon as possible. 

Unfortunately it sounds like you and your family have experience with this terrible disease. So they may have already been in contact with the Alzheimers Association. If you have not contacted them they are an AMAZING resource. They have a number you can call any time of the day.

I feel pretty terrible about it, I understand it will be easier to get it taken care of early and that she probably would never sign it if she new the true reason, but I just hate it. Legally she cant sign it over to me until Im 21, but I am the next in line if my uncle forfeits his power.

I think, imagine, probably not - You'd factor in their inability to comprehend, and do the right thing without guilt.

It's exactly the same now with your mom.  She can't take care of herself, and she can't comprehend the world in which she needs taking care of.  It's simply the right thing to get the necessary documents for her care.

You can never be too careful and the earlier you determine if this is the case the more options you will have as far as slowing the disease progression.

There are currently no effective therapies which slow the progression of the disease, however, there is a great deal of evidence connecting cardiovascular health with mental ability and memory in the elderly.

About half of them did die within a year. Most of those people were otherwise frail, depressed, and NOT getting appropriate physiotherapy (or nutrition).

That still leave the other HALF who were either motivated or resilient enough to get through it somehow. Some people need to get up and get walking after surgery and cannot be stopped. They keep on trucking for years with only mild progression of their dementia.

The biggest difference between the two groups was pro-active family support. I've seen families have to fight extremely hard to get the proper physiotherapy and after care to make the success stories. It's the people without family who stay belted in wheelchairs and never get the physio to get walking again; then die from the relentless pain of joint contractures.

My mother spent a few years in a nursing home, recovering from a cerebral hemorrhage. She introduced me to some of the other patients there, who received very few visitors and were simply aching for companionship. One by one I started adding them to my visits. My favorite was a 100 year old Albanian woman, who loved to relive how it felt to be a young girl, sweeping the courtyard with her sister, and the boys who gathered outside the door to catch a glimpse of the two of them. Her words made me feel like I was there with them, and the way her face lit up when she talked was simply beautiful.

0.4261,0.738,0.1399,0.8522,0.0,"What you are doing is, in my opinion, beautiful. My greatgrandmother (who I called Mumums), came to America from Ireland as a young woman looking to escape poverty. She went from washing sheep in the river on her family farm, to finding work as a laborer. She was a strong woman, with class and dignity. Towards the end, she had developed dementia and had to live in a nursing home. She too would cry and become frightened, calling my granmother to come bring her home. Eventually she began to lose touch with reality more often than not. She was, in her mind, a 20 year old woman living in Irleand again having amazing adventures. My grandmother would go to see her and ask, ""What did you do today Ma?"", and Mumums would tell her some wonderful story of having seen the priest at his home, or marching in a parade. At first this was heartbreaking, but we realized that if these ""memories"" made her life better, then why not celebrate the things she was ""doing""? These memories are as real to her as anything, enjoy the times you spend with her, in reality or otherwise. Thanks for the love you share for such a sweet sounding woman."

From the day I posted this, I have started thinking so differently about dementia. I first thought of them as random memories just popping up in a persons head, but now I feel like people with dementia actually relive those moments and are *there* when they talk or think about them. It kind of puts my heart at peace, a little bit. I feel bad about the fact that dementia exists, but when I think of it after reading about how they get so caught up in the moment *as if they are there, right there happening* it actually turns into something a tiny bit better.

To every person with dementia, I wish they will only relive the good moments, not the bad. Because they are memories too, and have probably had impact. That's what I hate most about it, I think.

My mom got put on prozac early on because her primary physician was looking hard for some other diagnosis, and sometimes memory problems in older people are a sign of depression.

After couple of years, when it was crystal clear that depression was not the problem, we decided to drop the prozac, since it seemed completely irrelevant.

Lo and behold, mom got a lot nastier, a lot harder to ""handle"".

This.

I didn't have the option of not visiting because I cared for my mother in her home during my father's illness and after he died. Her dark moods were frequent, and she used to stand in the bathroom raging at the image in the mirror. I figured if she didn't recognize herself she certainly wasn't hating me personally when she raged at me. 

&gt;how to stay supportive and continue visiting?
&gt;he might rather stay home.

The sad truth is that in the end it won't matter. But I agree with u/Lordica above. Don't hang around for the verbal rant. Disappear for awhile and return to see if things are any better, and if not, leave. Try to go on a weekend morning or early afternoon to avoid the sundown effect. Always speak in a calm, soothing tone, and try not to contradict what is being said that is hurtful because that is just fueling the fire. And don't take it personally.

Good luck."

People tell me I show very few or any symptoms of EOD, but then I know I am not able to function as an effective project manager any more.

I used to do online IQ tests for fun, and about 5 years ago i could still top 130. At the peak of my cognitive decline, before i started with the nootropics, I could scarcely hit 100.  These days I hover around 115 to 120, and it seems reasonably stable in that range."

It seems to me thinking of it that way will help you interact with your father - Really, if you think about, we do a lot of non-verbal communication as it is, facial expression and body language often tell us what's really going on when words are confusing or unclear.  If you keep that in mind, the lack of words will be less disorienting, I think.

I've known many people to try out the Medium Chain Triglycerides products like Axona or just eating coconut oil and the results haven't really been there. The same goes for most of the research- it has been studied in Alzheimer's patients, like many things have, but no one improvements were shown.

On the other hand, in the research it seems like a more strict ketogenic diet could hold some promise. In the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease there is often a huge insulin resistance problem that crops up after the accumulation of beta-amyloid but before the brain starts to be damaged irreparably. Hypothetically, removing the brain's dependence on that sugar that is impacted by the insulin resistance could offer you some resilience."

I'd be horrified too if a parent said suggestive things to me (as opposed to around me, which my Mom did, a lot).

My thinking is that with dementia, there's no expectation that he can get better or ""learn"" not to do it.  But the ""daughter"" aspect is pretty dramatic, dramatic enough, maybe, to involve a part of his brain that *can* remember, and if he *does* manage to remember, it'll only make him feel awful that he did such a thing.

1. I don't know if such a thing is ever considered ethical, and I don't know if the dementia has progressed to the point where your mom and dad no longer have a physical relationship.  But it's possible to minimize, dampen sex drive with medication.  You'd have to ask his Dr., or have your mom ask his Dr. if such a prescription would be a possibility for your dad.

The first is a short write up of a very small, non-randomized study.

The second expands in great detail on what was done in the study.

Everything they did involved diet, vitamins, minerals, and behavior (exercise, sleep, etc.)

For example, vitamin D level can be tested, and researchers at UC San Diego recently [published an analysis](http://www.newswise.com/articles/scientists-confirm-institute-of-medicine-recommendation-for-vitamin-d-intake-was-miscalculated-and-is-far-too-low) that shows recommended vitamin D supplementation is WAY lower than it should be.  And, a [5 year study in 1,658 elderly](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4153851/) found that the risk of developing dementia when serum Vitamin D3 levels were &gt; 50 nmol/L was very low.  (Current serum vitamin D levels are considered in the normal range as low as 20 nmol/L, but given these newer studies and analyses, I expect that to change at some point in the near future!)

As he explained it, we all have a morbid part of our personality but society teaches us to keep it it check, and that ability to do so regresses as the disease progresses.

It was a standard ketogenic diet - HIPLOC (65-30-5), MCT / Coconut oil, intermittent fasting - and it did wonders. Two 30 minute walks each day. Dropped whatever psycho-therarapeutic drugs I was on (e.g. whatever Glaxo Smith-Klein was awarding kickbacks on that year), and added a statin and an ACE inhibitor.

There's a transition from the life you *did* have together to the life you have together *now*, and as cold or callous as it may sound, you do learn new ways to cope and once you learn how to live in this new way, life gets a bit easier.

There *is* a light at the end of this long dark tunnel.  It may take years to get there (as I'm currently finding out), but continue on with the knowledge that this tunnel doesn't go forever, and you will find your way out if you keep moving forward."
0.0,0.0,0.9851,0.0,0.0,"Many, many more than 2 studies claim this.  Historically There have been two camps in Alzheimer's research. Those who focus on amyloid beta and believe it to be the preeminent pathogenic agent, and those who focus on tau.

The general consensus in the field more recently however, is that both are important in different ways. amyloid beta aggregation and toxicity is believed to be an early event, which triggers downstream processes such as tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation. Tau misregulation is thought to be the more direct cause of axon loss and neuronal death, which leads to the end stage Alzheimer's disease. 

That being said, many studies have shown the ability of amyloid beta to be directly toxic to neurons and to impair the cellular process of memory called Long Term potentiation.

Im not sure if anyone will even bother reading this, but if it helps you understand the most general consensus view of Alzheimer's disease research right now. Obviously there are still some people out there who believe only one or the other are important, but largely that is not the case anymore."

In all fairness to your mom, how could you possibly know what the spouses of millions of dementia patients do or don't do in the privacy of their homes 24/7?

She still loves your father, but every day your father becomes more and more like some bizarre stranger to her, a stranger with some very difficult behavior, and there's no way out for either of them—one is not responsible for his continuing mental changes and the other is not responsible for the terrible grief she feels watching her life partner deteriorate before her eyes.

Unfortunately, most of the help available costs money. Can your mom be persuaded to see a doctor or therapist on a regular basis who might be able to help her with her issues? Have you searched on http://www.alz.org to see if there is a chapter in your location? Even if not, they have an online forum where people can vent and also help each other—feeling that one is not alone in this role can be soothing. Is institutionalizing your father out of the question? Because maybe it's time.

Good luck to you and your family.

If she is loaded up on meds for her cholesterol, diabetes, blood pressure, heart disease, osteoporosis, stop them. If her doctor objects, find another doctor, perhaps one who has better ideas about calming drugs. Get a hospital bed with side rails and a cradle mattress so it is less likely that she will be able to get up and wander around in the middle of the night (hospices use these for dementia patients—perhaps there is a hospice near you which can tell you where to rent one). Have a DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) form drawn up and keep copies where you will have them in emergencies—one plastered somewhere in the house, like the fridge, one with you in your wallet or purse.

Potential remedies are drinking green tea and black coffee, reducing fatty meat consumption and taking regular exercise where possible.

Green tea has been shown to reduce and essentially declog the brain of beta amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles - the causation of excitotoxic and neurodegenerative stress accumulation over time.

Whereas coffee stimulates the production of bile acid from the gall bladder, aiding digestion of excess cholesterol in the liver (where cholesterol is manufactured, and not just absorbed from foods), leading to an overall reduction in cholesterol buildup.

I'd recommend 1-3 cups of either pure green tea or strong black organic coffee a day (milk inhibits the beneficial antioxidant flavonoid effects inherent in either)

Bananas are high in vitamin b6 (pyridoxine) - a crucial vitamin for long term memory potentiation.
Also, Brewer's yeasts like Marmite have high levels of b3, b6, and b12 which are also necessary for cognitive repair.
As we age, our ability to absorb b vitamins diminishes, which means we have to take higher levels in order to sustain our physical and mental well health.

Omega 3, 6, and 9 fish oils (available from Tesco, if you're in the UK) are doubly important, as they make up the stuff our brains are made from -- the white and the grey matter, as well as the myelin sheaths that shield our neutrons from attack from environmental stressors.

In short, yes, and I'm only 40 currently.  

My mother died from early onset in her mid 50's.  It very likely started somewhere her 40's with memory loss and progressed quickly.  It seemed to have a very noticeable progression of memory loss, once she couldn't hide it anymore (which was when she lost her job for being ""forgetful"" in her late 40's).

Mine has gotten worse as I've gotten older.  I'd always figured it was my seizure medication + cumulative effects of seizures frying my brain long term...but after Mom...I'm not so sure any more.  I've been working in the same field for a long time, and even something common I would talk about every day I sometimes forget.  Even when its explaining ""common"" things, answering the phone or giving out the phone number.  Thankfully we have (generally) understanding clients, and I can pass things off oftentimes as ""not sleeping well"" or ""not enough caffeine Hahaha!"" but I hate sounding so...stupid...to everyone when you forget things.

Its frustrating and scary in the larger picture.  I try not to dwell on it or I'd probably cry ;)  I do think on it though so I can decide what I want to do long or short (?) term.

If you scan the /r/Alzheimers subreddit and poke around a few medical databases, ketogenic diets are being tried to combat the buildup of plaque in the brain.

1. Continue working on getting her out of that facility.

2. Nursing homes are heavily regulated. If you are in Ohio, call the Ohio Department of Health (obviously, just change this to the state you are in). The complaint unit will hear your complaint and will work to keep you anonymous upon your request. A complaint surveyor(s) will come in to investigate. I guarantee you that you will get better care after this. Nursing home administrators and Directors of Nursing freak out if these people enter the building.Document any time that you share concerns with the staff. Document names, times, what happened.

3.The goal for residents is not to be bed bound.

Some animals, such as dogs and cats, also suffer from cognitive dysfunction.  The following observation about the treatment of canine dysfunction also applies to human beings with Alzheimer's disease.

Decline in cognitive functions that accompany aging in dogs may have a biological basis, and many of the disorders associated with aging in canines may be mitigated through dietary modifications that incorporate specific nutraceuticals. Based on previous research and the results of both laboratory and clinical studies – antioxidants may be one class of nutraceutical that provides benefits to aged dogs. Brains of aged dogs accumulate oxidative damage to proteins and lipids, which may lead to dysfunction of neuronal cells. The production of free radicals and lack of increase in compensatory antioxidant enzymes may lead to detrimental modifications to important macromolecules within neurons. Reducing oxidative damage through food ingredients rich in a broad spectrum of antioxidants significantly improves, or slows the decline of, learning and memory in aged dogs. However, determining all effective compounds and combinations, dosage ranges, as well as when to initiate intervention and long term effects constitute gaps in our current knowledge.

Our situation (mother diagnosed with vascular dementia) is that she doesn't require constant supervision and is fine around the house on her own. Still, I've moved back in to take care of her and we have a care provider who comes twice per week. This works well for us in that she's living in the family home of 40+ years. Depending upon the severity and the living circumstances, a care provider might be an option. Moving our mom into a care facility was definitely an option we didn't want to resort to since that pretty much would have meant that she'd never return home. In my experience, there's not much that can currently be done to reverse the condition, but you can minimize the progression by keeping her socially engaged, like visiting friends and family, and participating in senior activities. Don't let her fall into a rut."

You have a bit of time here, so don't let this issue strain the relationship. Your relationship and your and her happiness are key. Try to set up a support system for both of you now. Regular meetings or lunches with friends and family. 

I have noticed (this could just be in our case) that setting up a routine can help a person with dementia. We set up routines around meds and other important things long before they were needed. Now that the dementia has set in, there are fewer struggles over things that have been done for a while.

Remember, if they're not sleeping right now, it's not the end of the world. Stay calm and collected, and just try to keep her in the house. She'll go back to bed eventually.

I would be surprised if she was sleeping much at all, and that can make you even more disassociated from reality.  

If she is able to get more Ativan, would it be possible for you to limit her consumption to a pill a day?  She might need a higher dosage than what she had been taking, because she wasn't taking the prescribed dosage anyway.  Do be aware that Ativan is addictive, and will need to be increased with time to get to same effect.  There may be better anti-anxiety med that she could take, longer-term, without the risk of addiction, but that is her doctor's call.

Your grandma might not recall who you are when you call her because of the lack of information (she can't see your face, she can only hear a voice saying a name).

Give your mother in law a break.  A scheduled day that she can plan to get away.   I go hang out with my mom every  Sunday.    We Garden, go for walks, chat, cook together...   My father gets to go do something normal.   

The one thing you can give is time.   Work something out with your in-laws, to give your MIL a break.  I assure you - she needs it.

She lived with my sister, and after a couple of years had passed we talked one day about whether or not to continue the anti-depressant, as it had become crystal clear that her problems weren't related to depression.

But, once mom was completely off the anti-depressant, her temperament really went downhill, in that she got very snappish, testy, just all round confrontational and difficult.

So my sister went back to giving her the anti-depressant, and mom went back to being ok with things generally, accepting of help, direction, and all the other things necessary to keep her safe, healthy, clean, etc.

So, my personal experience is that medication can be something on the order of indispensable.

A really important concept in all this is that people with dementia are literally no longer capable of learning.

You can no more expect a dementia patient to ""grasp"" that they really do need the help than you would expect them to solve a problem in quantum physics.

2) If you have the extra cash, don't just hire a maid, find someone a housekeeper who has experience with caregiving. If your mother has a friend group her age, you could ask them or your fathers friends. Chances are by word of mouth someone in that group has or knows of someone who doesn't just clean but will do little extras like... cook a meal, go through the mail, set her pills up for the week etc. Even if its just two give your dad a few hours of rest once in a while. 
3) Visit when you can. If you visit you can provide support for your father, spend time with your mother, and take care of her for small amounts of time. If you alternate with your other brother then that's great.

Recursive- we've tried therapy when she was slightly more lucid and it was a total failure. She couldn't express herself at all or understand the therapist (who specializes in speech disorders). And now her memory is so poor I doubt that anything imparted by the therapist would be understood or remembered. I really like your idea of adult day care. But she is **very** attached to my dad and will even look out the gate waiting for him. But I will check this out and see what's available. 

I may have misspoke. Our ""helper"" is more than just a maid, she takes my mom for walks downtown every time she's here and tries to interact with my mom in any way possible. A new caregiver is coming who is even more specialized. She loves to pet the dogs downtown and treats our family dog like a second child. Thank you for your support Recurs

Naked- I'm so sorry for your dad. It's great to have family around to help. We have some family around, but they're more ""fair weather family"" but I'm going to try talking to them more; I think a lot of them just don't know how to help. I will keep an eye out for social activities, I think just being around people helps. Classes could be an option but her cognition is so compromised I doubt she could even dip a paintbrush in a palette or cup. Still worth looking into, thanks! I wish you and your dad ll the best.

This is really hard for some people, because it requires stepping out of denial about the fact that their loved one is not in the same reality and never will be, again.

Instead of arguing with him, just go along with his stories. A lot of head shaking and saying ""Ahhh. OK. Sure"" is required. Treat him with respect, and not like a child. Comfort him when he is afraid. My FIL had a scenario where he had been trapped out in the desert for days, without food or water.

Until a permanent solution is found, make sure he has constant supervision. A big change like this can be very disturbing. It will be easier on him if you stay in his house. Another option is respite care, which is him staying temporarily in a skilled nursing facility. That could buy you a few weeks until a decision is made.

In the long term, you should contact your county's Office on Aging for resources and services that he might qualify for, as well as places with open beds for respite care. An Elder Care Attorney is a good idea, as well. They can advise you regarding assets, income, qualifying for Medicaid vs. private pay (for in home or nursing home care), power of attorney.

I can't advise you as to where he should be permanently. What I do know is that being a caregiver will take over every aspect of your life. If you WANT to do it, and are ABLE to do it, great. But if you're not, that's okay too. That's no fault of yours, it's just life circumstances. If you want a good view of what life is like as a caregiver, check out the Facebook group ""dementia caregivers support group,"" as it's the best one I've found.

Explain certain choices to him- ""dad, I'm sorry but after the doctor told us about the dementia, we can't let you drive. It's not safe."" You can also use this time to get his input about his options, while he's in a moment of clarity- ""dad, we want to talk to you. The doctor said you have dementia, and we want to talk about what that means."" If his memory is still a few minutes long, you can try to have a conversation about his wishes/desires for care and treatment. When he progresses farther and gets to the point where he gets upset about that reminder, drop the topic and just live in his reality. If he is like my LO, he will deny adamantly until she is blue in the face that there is an issue. :)  In the earlier stages, they're aware of a loss of function, but psychological coping mechanisms like denial take over.

If you're female, it might not be too intrusive for you to accompany her to the bathroom and just make sure she's going to use the toilet before exiting and letting her finish on her own. As for constant monitoring, who's present at any given time of the day, you, your dad, the caregiver? Are there more than one of you present throughout the day? I know what it's like wanting her to have supervision 24/7, so it might be useful for there to be two people present throughout the day, where the two switch off on dedicated monitoring shifts.

That's the most important point. Genetics don't play anywhere near the role that age does as far as risk factors go for dementia. The older you get the, the greater your risk of developing some form of dementia (which by all accounts is a complex disease with many facets and contributing factors). IIRC after 60 or so your chances of developing dementia doubles every five years you remain alive. But also note that dementia is *not* predestined.

I moved home briefly for a little over a year and had to move out because my own mental health was suffering. My heart breaks every time I go home to see my parents. If I think too much about it I end up crying. I cried a lot when I first heard the diagnosis. Less now, but I still do.

0.5217,0.8151,0.0,0.9412,0.0511,"I think it really depends upon the type, severity, and her living situation. My mom has vascular dementia, which isn't too bad; it's mainly her short term memory and becoming easily confused. Her long term memory isn't too impaired. It's still kind of difficult for me in that she's not quite the same capable, independent woman who raised me. It didn't really become an issue until my dad passed away, after which I moved back from out of state to live with and take care of her. So, there's really not much you can do in the way of preparation for how her dementia will affect you. Hopefully, it's not too severe and you will be able to keep her engaged with family, relatives, friends, and any social groups she may belong to. From my personal experience, I'm of the opinion that you can draw comfort by striving to make her continued life as engaged and happy as possible. Try not to let your perception of her life from this point forward seem one of isolation and tedium. I think the best you can do is be satisfied that you tried and succeeded in making her quality of life as enjoyable as you could, that you weren't remiss. I wish you the best of luck."

Something that took me a while to learn was that You have to be the one to change, someone with AD can't change their behavior as much of the time they aren't even aware of it. Perhaps keeping her up later the night before so she sleeps in naturally, or placing a partially started jigsaw puzzle in her room or something else she enjoys so she will see it, or maybe when you get in from work before you sleep wake her and do something she will enjoy like reading a book to her. These are not all ideal (un disturbed sleep is vital to her as well, she may not notice a puzzle at all, and she may wake naturally at sun up no matter when she goes to sleep) but you will find something that works.

It may seem simple and logical to you (writing the notes, expecting her to understand that you are there but asleep, etc) but it doesn't mean anything to her. She is most likely looking for some reassurance and is frightened at feeling alone or separated.  That was a great suggestion of inviting her to share your bed for a while - it might make her feel more secure. But when my wife wants to get up, if I try to get her to stay in bed longer, she becomes extremely fidgety and it defeats the purpose.  The diversion tactics often work but I'm guessing that they won't here since she is wanting the security of you.  A consideration would be for you to nap sometime during the day and catch up on your sleep then.  It's a tough situation but a phase that she may move through in a month or so.

Sometimes you can gently correct when they are worrying about something (Where's my car? Oh, it's in the shop right now.) to find an answer they can live with. I realize it's a bit more difficult in your situation since she remembers your dad's passing so well. We lost my MIL 11 years ago, and my FIL doesn't even remember being married at all (after &gt; 50 years of marriage!).

When she asks what you're going to do with the house, ask her what are her wishes. Pose it as *if* she doesn't return home what would she prefer. The answer may or may not be realistic, but just listen. 

And yes, be prepared to answer the same questions over and over. We sometimes adjust the answer a little bit depending on how the last one went over. It sounds like your mother is still pretty high-functioning for a dementia patient -- she's asking about relatively recent stuff -- so you probably can't get too far from reality.

Great idea. Also, tell them everything that is going on with your father. Everything.

&gt;Do you think I'm right that this is a major warning sign he is no longer safe all the time? His doctors seemed to not give a darn. 

There is absolutely no doubt that your father is a danger to himself and possibly others. Something major is going on with your dad and don't let up until you find a doctor that will help you figure this out. He could have some type of physical illness or he could have a mental heath problem or he could have some type of Dementia. But there is a problem!

When you and the docs figure out what's going on with him, he may need someone to come to his home to assist him on a daily basis. If he rejects this, you may be forced to put him in a assisted living facility. If it comes to this, more than likely, he will be very angry with you for awhile. But do not let that stop you from protecting your father and doing what you know is best for him. Good Luck.

I usually avoid asking a lot of questions and instead tell him things like ""You know what I was thinking about the other day? The time we went to Washington for the family reunion. That was a lot of fun"" and if he remembers he participates. 


Sometimes I'll just talk to him about topics instead of specific things, like the other day I asked him if he believes in UFOs.

Part of my job is to read  the medical literature on a daily basis to ensure we stay current.  Large studies show (check out David Bennetts work at Rush Hospital Chicago) that brains of people with genetic predisposition (apoE 4/4) often have normal cognition until death even though they are riddled with amyloid and tau, and people without apoE 4 can have cognitive decline.  Genes may only account for 1/3rd of cases.  The rest is based on modifiable factors (early menopause without estrogen replacement, mid life obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, concussion, depression, standard American diet, lack of exercise).  Near daily strenuous exercise (just get the heart rate up!) and adopting the Mediterranean diet (vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, white meat, 4 tbl olive oil a day, fish 3-4 times a week, way less white bread, way less red meat, coffee, dark chocolate, red wine) can cut your risk by at least 50%.

If she's refusing or forgetting to take meds, she does need more/different care-- I think a hospital evaluation and placement is a good step. Don't expect that this is the end of the road, though- many people have a very difficult adjustment to 24/7 care. If she does stay in a dementia unit/nursing home, one way you can ease the transition is to say that ""you can go home once you're healed and the doctor approves it."" Most will be agitated and demand to go home, but framing her stay there as a medical necessity may help. After some time, she might stop asking to go home. 

 The good news is that with UTIs, once the infection has been dealt with, there is often a slight improvement in behavioral issues- the UTI definitely temporarily exacerbates symptoms. If the doc doesn't bring it up first, ask about taking antibiotics as preventive treatment; people with multiple UTIs are much more likely to contract another one.

Now she's in her early 70's. She's always had some OCD-like behaviors: hoarding, obsessive checking, hypervigilance type stuff. Things have been getting progressively worse.

She went to a neurologist after a TIE (mini stroke) and was dignosed with early dementia. The truth is, Personality Disorder, dementia, other mental illness, small strokes, absence seizures...a lot of it runs together when people get older. The only way to get an official diagnosis is to see a neurologist and get the scans done. 

There may be something they can give her to keep dementia from progressing, but it goes together with other untreated mental illnesses. If she had any strokes, they could give her medication to regulate blood pressure and maybe blood thinners. I don't know what they do for absence seizures.

If you are with her, and she seems absent, you could call 911 for suspicion of stroke or seizure. That would be the easiest way to begin an evaluation with a neurologist if she's refusing to go on her own. Of course, she could refuse transport to the hospital.

However, as a professional caregiver for the elderly with dementia, that has a lot of contact with doctors and clinicians, most geriatric clinicians can still recognize when a dementia patient also has a mental disorder. Mental disorders do carry over into early and moderate dementia (last stages everyone is pretty much the same). However, unless there is a prior known diagnosis of the mental disorder, dementia becomes so dominate that a diagnosis of the type of mental disorder becomes extremely difficult or even impossible. 

My point being, that most nurses, clinicians, CNA's, and others that have a lot of experience with dementia patients can usually tell when a patient also has some type of mental disorder. I can, unless it is something relatively minor, as well as most people I know that work with dementia patients. Actually, it's already been studied.

At least in a home, there are every 2 hour diaper/bathroom checks, frequent med passes to deal with the insomnia, agitation and depression of the residents. Also, usually snack and hydration every two hours too. Is it like a real home? No, but modern society and the ages to which people are now living, makes this type of home care increasingly difficult. You should discuss hospice care, either at a hospice center, her own facility or at your home. I cannot see protracting her life with more fluid infusions and antibiotics while she sits confused in a nursing home to be the kindest path. "

I cannot say for sure how your mom with progress (suddenly or slowly), but It has been my experience, they do not just suddenly fall off the cliff. Most of the people I have seen will start to slowly go down again without any rebounds. 

My mother was diagnosed 3 years ago. At that time, the best we could tell she was at a stage 4. We had her put on the Exelon patch. For the first year on Exelon, I feel as though she teetered back and forth between stage 4 to early stage 5. But, for the past few months, all I have seen is just a slow downward progression. I would say now she is getting close to a late stage five.

&gt;Like so many things we do, to forestall the inevitable, to scratch out every faint hope to spend just one more quality second with our loved ones. Even when the larger calculus of someone's life points to an unhindered end being the best thing for all concerned.

I total agree. I would even go one further and say it is for our own selfishness. We are thinking about ourselves, not our loved one's. From what I have experienced and witness, in my heart, I am starting to believe this is ethically wrong. However, dementia patient's are presently guinea pigs for (hopefully) future medical advancement. But, is this justification?

Yes, you can think of it similarly to HIV. Its unlikely that we will ever ""cure"" Alzheimer's disease, similar to cancer, because it is genetic and spontaneously arrises as we age, as opposed to viruses which we can vaccinate against and eliminate completely (like polio).

However, I was recently reading a review article by two of the biggest names in Alzheimer's disease research (Holtzman and Selkoe), and they stated that they believe Alzheimer's will be a treatable disease, much the same as HIV is today, within the next 20 years.

*  She could have been molested or sexually assaulted in the past. That may make her uncomfortable with being touched in certain ways.

* She may be startled due to hearing or vision problems.  If she's got a bad left ear or something, approach on the right.

Regarding the bedtime, that was a huge challenge for my elder.  Prior to being in a facility they were a super night owl like me.  That meant dinner around 8, staying up till 1 am usually, and sleeping till 10 or even 11 am.  The facility ran much earlier: breakfast prior to 8, dinner just before 5.  It didn't mesh well with their schedule.  If she's got a history of night owl behavior, or insomnia, or other things, perhaps her care plan needs to take that into account.

Regarding moving stuff in, you'll want to check with the admissions coordinator. They will go over furniture and moving things in when you fill out an admission's packet. Typically they will just want to make sure there is room for what you want to bring (especially if it's a semi-private room), and make sure that nothing breaks their fire code. Also, they will hopefully make sure you know that they do not take responsibility for his belongings, so it could potentially be a big gamble if he brings laptops, ipads, etc.

My loved one wanders too, but always brings her purse. If so, you might be able to find a way to hide or secure it to that item. Like this incident you described, it's not a foolproof strategy because they might not bring it- but it's an idea. I charge it twice weekly, and re-sew it into the lining of her purse each time. There are different power settings- to save battery, you can put it in airplane mode and just activate to tracking mode when you need to locate her. It is VERY accurate., quick and user friendly. I have used it three times to find my loved one. I think it was like $130 to buy the device, and $13/mo for a service plan. Worth it. We will keep it until my loved one is immobile/bed bound.

After a few years the paranoia came back, medication was changed again and then we had a few months of somewhat normalcy.

My mum was never much of a very nice person. I think I have never actually said that before. My dad acts like she was perfect, and I think there has been some rewriting of history going on. I sometimes wonder whether I am the only person who remembers what she was actually like.

It's interesting to me - may not be to anyone else - that my mum has been a big smoker for 70 or so years. It's only in the last year of having her brain fried by this condition/disease that she has stopped craving cigarettes. She stopped recognising me years before. 

Edi because I didn't think to say this at the time: 

One of the reasons the doctor thought my mum had vascular dementia rather than one of the other forms was because her deterioration was in steps ie. maintain behaviour for x months and overnight it changes to something worse...then maintained for a while, then suddenly it changes again.

So the thought was that the changes were being caused by mini strokes rather then a gradual deterioration, and the scan (I think MRI) confirmed it."

One thing I wish we did is what you're doing - asking questions and looking for outside support. I think we were too proud and simply didn't know/think any resources existed out there to help us. 

That being said, it be worth getting in touch with the Lewy Body dementia Foundation (https://www.lbda.org/). They have specialists and can talk you through what resources might be available in your area to get your grandfather care at home.

0.489,0.6787,0.1191,0.7837,0.0972,"You did fine considering the circumstances, but here are a couple suggestions:

The common advice I've heard for this kind of situation is to tell him that his wife has run some errands and she'll be back soon, or has gone to see a family friend for a couple of days (of course, if the wife is sitting right there, she has to cooperate with the idea or all hell will break loose).  This concept also works well if the spouse has passed away.  It's a kinder approach than reminding the remaining spouse every.time.they.ask that their wife/husband has passed as the news feels fresh to them every time and brings on grief all over again and again and again... 

As far as requests to ""go home"", many times, when dementia patients are asking to do that, it's not necessarily to the home that they just lived in but it's actually their childhood home.  They know something is wrong and are searching for the place *and the people* (i.e. Mom/Dad) that provided the most comfort to them.

There have been adult kids who actually take their parents back to visit the old homeplace just to have them get upset because the people they want to see there are, of course, long gone.  The picture is incomplete so it provides them only confusion rather than comfort. 

You can hear more about these techniques and others by watching Teepa Snow's videos on YouTube.

That's a great handout 

Some other techniques for dealing with the sun downing are to close all the curtains/blinds and use bright lights inside (the shadows and change from light to dark can be disorienting), play music he likes, and engage him (rather than entertaining himself with TV or whatever he usually does) to keep him focused. Perhaps you could give him tasks to help him feel useful and stay busy- he could polish unloaded guns, or take the newspapers out to the garage, whatever. A low dose of melatonin can also help some people. 

We will agree to disagree on the guns. "

Come nightfall and we have the whole lighting and environmental situation under control, although around he wants the lighting turned down because that's what he's so used to doing. And I totally see where you're coming from about taking him to the gun club and shooting, it sucks, but that's honestly the only activity he's happy to do.

I work in a long term facility and we get a lot of patients with dementia.

It's no fault of the loved ones, it's just the progression of the disease. If I were to have dementia later on, I would rather be placed in a facility with professionals trained to deal with it than to be an increasing burden on my loved ones.

All the issues you list are classic Alzheimer's/dementia symptoms. It is often said that Alzheimer's is harder on the caregiver(s) than the patients since those afflicted by the disease aren't all that aware of how bad it is. Seeing my dad suffer from Alz, however, I'm not so sure if that is true. I know you are young (I was 24 when my dad was diagnosed, 27 now), but you have to understand that this is the reality of the disease and it is something your grandmother *suffers* from. It will not get better. We all have stress, none of us are equipt to ""deal with"" this disease. Even professional caregivers struggle with caring for dementia/Alz patients. 

Find professional help. It does not seem like you watching her for 4-5 hours/day is a viable option. You need to ask your mom and her doctor what the options are to get her into full-time care. 

Also, there are a lot of resources out there that offer protocol for things like asking about dead relatives, basically you should not tell her they are dead but just say they are out at the store, at work, will be home later, etc. I would highly suggest doing some research: http://www.alzheimers.gov/coping.html.

I care for my mother who has advanced Alzheimer's Disease. In relation to pharmacy, maybe I can say that the good relationship I have with her pharmacist have over time become more and more crucial to me as her caregiver.

The complex of anti-depressant, anti-psychotic, anti-anxiety medicines for AD, on top of meds for things like BP, thyroid, reflux etc, and the rate at which the AD meds need to be changed as my mother declines, is something that the caregiver has to get on top of, but the interactions and effects, and side-effects of the various meds, are completely beyond my layman's comprehension. 

When things go wrong behaviourally or physically with my mom, I really needed a go-to person who I can tell what is happening to my mom by simply picking up the phone and calling them, or popping in to see them. 

Given that Doctors are not available by just walking into their rooms, for me that go-to person is my mom's pharmacist. So if my mom starts shuffling, or bruising tremendously easily, or is persistently loosing weight, or is not sleeping, or whatever, it is her pharmacist that I call or drop in on, and his advice is always amazing, and he is compassionate, interested and goes out of his way to help.

The availability of the pharmacist in caring for my mom is one of the rare magical elements in the disaster story of this awful, awful disease Alzheimer's. "

If diagnosed, a child will experience quick and progressive mental and physical deterioration over the course of several years — similar to Alzheimer’s disease, hence its nickname of “childhood Alzheimer’s.” Like Alzheimer’s, Niemann-Pick disease type C has no cure and typically leads to death.

As a new in-law this can put you in a awkward situation. The immediately family (husband, children) need to get involved. Your future mother-in-law can be in denial, for whatever reason, or just unaware because of the dementia, and that can put the family in a situation of forcing or tricking her to go see the doctor. Either way can be a very unpleasant experience for everyone involved. But, no matter what it takes, they need to get her to her doctors before she gets hurt.

My suggestion would is to talk to your fiancé. If your fiancé has brothers, or sisters, they should talk and get involved. If not, and your fiancé is the only child, then it would be up to you and your fiancé. But your fiancé need to be on board.

But I tend to disagree with the conclusion that she doesn't have some kind of dementia. The early stages of Alz don't show up in imaging. There is often no physical evidence of the the mini strokes that lead to vascular dementia. I think vascular dementia may be worth investigating too, not that it matters too much because none of it is particularly treatable. Whatever the case may be, her behavior probably won't get any better and will likely become difficult at some point, and medication may help manage it.

The staff put her on lockdown, as assisted-living did not have secure entryways and, conceivably she could have ""escaped.  "" 

It was a terrible, traumatizing night for everybody.

Listening to the rants, being berated, etc etc is hard too. and then there's the moment in time when I'm no longer remembered (long past the time of being loved by my mom) and then it becomes easier to stay away because 'I' am busy and she doesn't know me and she doesn't care if I come. So my needs become more important.
4 Education?  We need to teach people how important memory is to all of us. Without it, we can't make decisions, never mind good ones. We can't love or heal or pray or .... take your pick. Our limits are personal and dependent on each individual but they're always there, once the memory goes. Additionally, we all think our memories are accurate.

In a demented person the part of the brain that causes us to be impulsive, which leads to bad decisions and behaviors, becomes overly active as compared to a normal brain.

This is what is happening to your grandma. She has lost her ability to control her impulses. 

All the abnormal things that are happening in the brain of someone with Dementia usually manifest differently for each individual person. In your grandma's case, she has diabetes. And because she cannot control her impulses along with the fact that she is forgetful, this is why is behaving the way she is about food and eating.  

Of course because of her diabetes, you should try everything you can to keep her from sneaking food.

Obviously tell her in advance that you are going to the doctor, but try to bring more attention to the other things you are going to do with her.
If your MIL indeed has a form of dementia this is going to be a very long and hard road for all of you and it is best that she feel like she trusts you.

The bill says it will help with the cost of *care planning* which is great, but Medicare is severely lacking when helping with the cost of day to day caregiving. Right now Medicare will only pay 20 hours a week for a nurse (not a CNA, health aide, or family member) to care for someone with dementia in the home. Also, If a person only has Social Security for income (and nothing else). It is extremely difficult to find decent skilled nursing facilities that will except someone with dementia. **This needs to change.** Until congress and the president pass a bill that also improves Medicare coverage for caregiving expenses, the burden of this disease is still going to be to overwhelming for most.  

This bill is definitely a move in the right direction, but for most people with dementia this is a very long protracted illness. Sometimes 10 to 20 years. Even those that have planned well for retirement can easily lose everything they have to receive decent care, and in the end be left with nothing for decent care.

Do as another has suggested, and seek help/assistance from the state, as well as looking to 'A Place for Mom'. Your grandma's wandering is an accident waiting to happen, and there are probably other at-risk things going on, maybe involving electricity and things that catch fire, for which you can't reasonably be expected to catch all of them unless the *only* thing you're doing is focusing your attention on her when it's ""your shift"", which, again, isn't fair to you.

Stay with a friend or relative while you figure things out. Anything will be better than this.  
Not everyone is made out to be a caregiver. Later stage dementia patients are very difficult to handle, they can do harm to themselves or even others if not handled the right way.

Just go with the flow. 

Ignore the meltdowns. If she seems upset, do not try to engage, it may only confuse her or agitate her further. Let someone who is more aware of her behaviors diffuse any issues. Keep conversation simple. BRING PICTURES!! She may or may not recognize you now, but there is a way higher likelihood of her recognizing old pics of you and the family. Looking through a bunch of old photos is sometimes very therapeutic. Socially it is low impact on the brain, and old memories/long established memories linger the longest. Looking through photos also puts less pressure on you to find the right thing to say. Bring a giant stack and describe the happy events in the pictures. No sad pics for obvious reasons. 

Mellow, neutral tones and relaxed body language is a must. Think Zen and you'll be fine. When you make eye contact, smile, not grin, but a warm ""you are safe because we love you"" smile.

It is a statement of fact that he has been working for months without getting paid. It is a statement of fact that he has not been paying bills on time. Why is he working without getting paid? Then, couch seeing a neurologist as a way of possibly addressing these difficulties. If you can get him to buy in to that, then you'll be good to go.

Finally, I'd direct your reading regarding etiologies towards [FTD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontotemporal_dementia).

""The amyloid-β protein remains in the vicinity of the operated tissue and does not spread considerably or affect other brain regions. There were also no clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and no characteristic deposits of the tau protein were seen.""

But my more radical contention is that even theoretically if the operation were on the hippocampus, it would not make a difference.  
Indeed, amyloid plaques by absorbing copper and zinc stop the production of hydrogen peroxide that seems to play a critical role in prion disease and in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.

If you mom continues to display these behaviors, she really needs to start the process of getting a diagnoses. If she does have dementia, the earlier she can get diagnosed the better off she will be.

Step 1 - Try to get her to see her General Practitioner and make sure he/she knows about your moms recent behaviors, and memory issues. Her GP will give her a complete physical and blood test to rule out anything physical. Then Step 2 - He/she should refer your mom to a Neurologist who will order a brain scan or MRI. Then Step 3 - the Neurologist will either refer her to a Psychiatrist for cognition testing or the neurologist may be able to diagnose her without the cognition test.

I remember one night I wanted to make something extra special for dinner for Gram. I made this fancy pasta dish that took a really long time to make(like several hours start to finish). Dinner was ready, but unfortunately it was ready 20 minutes after the usual dinner time. Gram spent the rest of the night telling me I am a horrible human being for trying to starve her, how I was a horrible wife and mother and she was so disappointed in how I turned out, and that my food was 'utter shit' (she doesn't swear). This went on non stop until bedtime...3 hours later. That night I got drunk and cried myself to sleep.

The only remote possibility that I can think of to make her remaining years more bearable is to find something that, to her, would make her life worth living.

I do believe it's possible that your family could do a better job of feeding your Grandma. That said, there's probably a good reason why she isn't eating so much, and getting her those calories might be more work than you imagine. 

In our building, we put the food in front of them, slice the meat for those who need help, and offer positive reinforcement. But we legally can't put the food into their mouths, and some residents end up spending an extra hour at meal-time. And even then, they might only take a few bites. 

People get pickier, they lose interest in eating, they get confused by eating - any reason you can imagine. And there's no way staff has the time to sit with the residents that need help - because they'd have to be sitting with them for the entire meal, one-on-one, bite-by-bite, and there simply isn't the manpower. Out of our 15 residents, at least 7 of them aren't eating much at most meals. And our food is really good! For those who need ensure, we certainly make sure they get it regularly.

Sometimes, all of the scientific community is wrong, and a handful of mavericks change their minds.  99% of the time, the mavericks are just wrong.  The problem with the NY Post article is that it fails to place this editorial within that context.  Every reader of the scientific journal knew that this was a radical outside idea; probably few NY Post readers grasp that."

Personally, it sounds to me like she *should* be in assisted living.  Having round-the-clock personnel on hand to help her, as well as likely having a nurse there is a huge thing.  So is consistent management of her prescriptions.  If she can't afford to do it, consider signing her up for a reverse mortgage to pay for the cost and be sure to find a facility that will take Medicaid for her care after her funds run out.

For my mom, it has to do with things like being reminded to conserve water (we're in California) or always being relieved of the duty of putting the dishes and plates away since she'll put them in the wrong places or chip them because she's not careful.

There are a range of tests though it really depends on what you want to achieve?

Do you want to screen for dementia or do you want to produce memory exercises as they are quite different things. So far there is little in terms of memory exercise apps and the latest evidence is that's only effective media based tools are are those that have an assistant. You would probably be better with an exercise app as that is the biggest predictor of progression.

The traditional cognitive tests also suffer from repetition effects and we rarely retest more than six monthly as there are learning biases.

The main tests we use are 

Ace3 though you need to be an English speaker, literate and educated to the age of 16.

MOCA faster and better for frontal changes

RUDAS bit of a blunt instrument but easily used for those who are illiterate or do not have English as a first language with an interpreter present.

We also use Basoll as an OT screen 

Our neuropsychologist uses much more specialist tools but that can take an hour or more to administer

For screening:

* Visual Association Test (VAT) Implicite visual learning test for the recognition of retrograde amnesia
* Further: Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Cognitive Screening Tool (CST), MOCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), CAMCOG (Cambridge Cognitive Examination)


More specific tools:

* 8WT or 15WT: 8 of 15 woordenleertaak which translates as wordlearning task
* BADS: Behavioural Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndroms, for executive functioning
* ADS6: Amsterdam Dementia Screening test 
* Complex Rey Figure for visuospatial functioning, strategic planning and memory
* EMCT: Expanded Mental Controle Test for Attention and mental flexibility
* TMT: Trail Making Test also for attention and mental flexibility

This is just a small selection of tools we use in our work. Also: the selection of tests you want to use is often dependent on the cognitive functioning of the patient (and often the type of dementia or brain damage)

EDIT: Also, These tests don't give a 100% certainty about the presence of a neurodegenerative syndrom. Results should be interpreted with a clinical and experienced eye.

PhD student studying alzheimer's disease here. Our lab focuses on the connection between heart and brain health, and theres a pretty strong one. Honestly, anything that would be good for the heart is probably a safe bet. low salt/ low cholesterol diet and especially some daily exercise if your mother is up for it. These things will not stop the disease though (if she does have it), they are associated with reduced risk of developing the disease, but correlation does not imply causation, so we really dont know at this point whether it will actually make a difference, especially in people who are already diagnosed. It certainly wont hurt though."

We wanted her to stay home because it's what she would have wanted before Alzheimer's. We had a 24 hour home aide and so she was able to continue to stay at home.Also myself and my parents lived across the street so we were always available, but she was miserable and her angry outbursts were worse. Our lives were consumed. Finally she broke her hip and we decided it was time to move her into a facility. She is much happier there. We thought that she should stay home because thats what she had wanted before the disease. But she has always been social, and once the disease took hold, her needs weren't the same. She wasn't living in the same world as she was before and once we accepted that, and catered to her new world, things became so much easier. Forcing her into her old world was hopeless and frustrating for everybody. It's a personal choice of course, and my advice isn't really about home care vs. a facility.

The GP played it off as a general checkup and asked to call me in from the waiting room when my SO failed a memory test. He had me record the second memory test he gave using my phone. This helped later when my SO wanted to cancel the subsequent neurology appointment as it was ""unnecessary"".  Hearing it from the doctor made it much easier to accept.

You may want to look into some ways to get you a little respite.

Day programs are what they sound like - kind of like a daycare, but for adults who are not so bad they need a care home, but still need more attention/stimulus/supervision than they can get at home.

About one third of FTD cases are familial.  Page 3.  In this context, ""familial"" means that the patient has genetic mutations in at least one of the known genes associated with expression of the disease.  Page 3.  Those genes include *MAPT*, *progranulin*, and *C9ORF72*.  Pages 7-8.  There might be mutations in other genes, but those are quite rare.  Page 8.  

The remainder of cases are called ""sporadic"" - meaning that they have no known cause.  Page 3.  It doesn't refer to any sporadic timing of symptoms.  

In light of this, FTD doesn't switch from being familial to being sporadic.  It's either genetic (~30% of cases) or not (the rest).  

Like you, I'd like to get the genetic testing.  From what I've learned talking with people in the biz, it appears that the first step is getting the diagnosed patient tested to see what (if any) genes contain mutations.  That way, the later genetic tests on relatives can just focus on those genes, or further genetic tests can be skipped if it's not genetic.  I am going to figure out how to get testing and how much it costs.  I'll keep you informed and provide you with any information I run across."

One sister gave her something off the counter to help her solidify her BMs but then she's complaining of stomach aches and so on.  I took her to the specialist and he said she had an impacted bowel and hadn't had diarrhea in years.  So all we could do was listen to her complaints and let it go.

Think of it in the same mindset you would handle a child. He simply didn't know any better. If you are acting as a caregiver it's important that you always remember he doesn't know better and it's why he needs the help.

Going forward anticipate the behavior and plan around it.  

Being a caregiver isn't easy.  I can't even begin to imagine what it's like to care for your own family member. If you are feeling overwhelmed or even need a short break to handle the recent situation con the social worker and see if he's eligible for respite care.

It's possible an ambiguous social signal was misinterpreted while he was missing the context of *who you are* among other things like his age/date/place, making it exceptionally unfortunate, inappropriate and uncomfortable for you.

My first strategy would be to alter my own behaviour, keep a bit more physical distance and definitely change the goodbye ritual to a gentle pat on the arm or shoulder instead of a hug or kiss. I might even consider wearing specific clothing, basically anything I can do to provide him with contextual cues that guide him toward the appropriate behaviour.

So my only concern is that you don't dump him into care because of one incident, but rather only if it's the best thing for him. Which it may very well be! And don't take it personally - in fact, have a beer, try to forget it, and if you can't, at least try to forgive him."

It's hard to say, and it's different for everyone. I've been told by many people that if you're starting to wonder if it's time, it's probably time. 

Some common reasons: 

-  when Mom/Dad requires 24/7 care, but the caregiver cannot stay home with them

-  when the person with dementia becomes incontinent.

-   when the person starts wandering outside the home, and the home can't be adequately secured. 

-  when the person with dementia is bored and not stimulated, and would do better surrounded by more people 

-  when delusions and hallucinations are uncontrollable 

-  when aggression becomes a problem 

-  when the caregiver is burned out- their mental and physical health is at risk 

What does your mom think? How is she coping? How long will their financial resources support him staying at home?

I just want to point out that Alz is not trending towards younger diagnoses at this point to the best of my knowledge. If you have a source on that statement, I'd love to see it.

The # of cases will triple by 2050 because the population is aging, which means that there will be more people over the age of 65 by then than there are now. It has nothing to do with people getting Alz earlier in life. Early onset Alz is most commonly due to genetics and is thus heritable, while late onset is sporadic and age is the greatest risk factor.

If you're going to come into this sub to spread information, thats wonderful, but please back it up with reputable sources as much as possible.

A good course of action would be to contact your local Ombudsman's office and let them know whats going on. They can go in there and check the place out as well as dig around if they see anything suspicious. 
You can also contact the local Community Care Licensing office and make a complaint (Its the social services department for senior care facilities). The facilities' licensing number will be posted on their website  somewhere, use that to reference when making the complaint.

It is important to realize that this study was done entirely in a petri dish, using human brain cancer cells from a tumor. These results will hopefully translate into future animal and human studies, but it is still way too early to know.

Most of this paper focused on inflammation in neurons that are artificially forced to produce amyloid beta, the neurotoxin present in Alzheimer's. Interestingly, they conclude the cannabinoid PGD2 is neuroprotective, where previous other studies have concluded the opposite results. This is something they fail to acknowledge or explain in their discussion. They claim that the cannabinoid THC is the most neuroprotective of the cannabinoids, which is an exciting finding, even in an artificial system. Finally, the most exciting result is the demonstration that blocking the RAGE protein is neuroprotective. Currently, there is a large human clinical trial recruiting to determine if anti-RAGE drugs will slow Alzheimer's progression. This paper supports this hypothesis, and we will see the results in the next few years.

Unless you hear the alarm going off in the middle of the night, let him wander throughout the house. ""Baby proof"" the house by hiding tools, taking knobs off stove, putting household cleansers out of sight, etc. Make sure there are clear paths to walk, that he doesn't have to navigate around shelves and tables to get out of his room. Make the house as safe as possible. Put the dogs outside during meal time, or in a different room. 

A lot of these issues are him trying to be helpful- fixing the sink, rearranging things, feeding the dogs. Find a way that he thinks he's being helpful, and gear it towards his interest. Maybe a fiddle board depending on how advanced he is? Can he sort a big bucket of nuts and bolts? With dementia, they can't be expected to entertain themselves. Try playing music he likes, as well.

&gt; The researchers found that high levels of amyloid beta were associated with cellular inflammation and higher rates of neuron death. They demonstrated that exposing the cells to THC reduced amyloid beta protein levels and eliminated the inflammatory response from the nerve cells caused by the protein, thereby allowing the nerve cells to survive.

&gt;“Inflammation within the brain is a major component of the damage associated with Alzheimer’s disease, but it has always been assumed that this response was coming from immune-like cells in the brain, not the nerve cells themselves,” says Antonio Currais, a postdoctoral researcher in Schubert’s laboratory and first author of the paper. “When we were able to identify the molecular basis of the inflammatory response to amyloid beta, it became clear that THC-like compounds that the nerve cells make themselves may be involved in protecting the cells from dying.”"

Do you have history of alcoholism; do you have sleep apnea (or are extremely overweight); do you have depression? These can often muddy neuropsychiatric results and can even be seen on pet-scans. 

Is the clinic you went to especially known for FTD diagnoses and treatment? Although FTD is more well known than in the past, I would expect that diagnosis is still dicey. Unless the clinicians themselves have extensive experience with FTD, I would get to a clinic that does. A lot of time, they can help with costs.

Well, I don't think you really do. Going through this has to take some mental, physical, and emotional toll. It just has to. So you just cope as well as you can - which is all you can do. 

The necessities for me:

An intact sense of humor. When you start losing that you need help right away. That is what made me pickup the phone and call a therapist finally.  

An ability to lie. We like to call them ""fiblets"" and that's OK but sometimes you need to pull a whopper out of nowhere.

We did cut back of animal proteins (milk meat) and tried alot of raw smoothies and lots of things like Mucuna Pruriens, Chlorella powders.

I thought having Netflix at the bed would fix this but being asked to move to the bed seems to just set myself up for disappointment.  I make sure I'm around when the timer shuts off and the bed is all set up. He complains that the computer is broken and after a few clicks of the dead mouse I concede that he is right and say but this screen is working and get Netflix to pick up where it left off. I am suddenly a hero and he can't get to bed fast enough!  I can't tell you how many evenings I dreaded getting him to go to bed before I figured this out. I feel slightly guilty for the lie (only slightly) but before I would set a alarm for a few hours and wake up to try to get him to bed and make sure he had not gotten confused etc. a few weeks of waking up every few hours will make you dig through the Christmas boxes!

We are in ""the most remote urban area in the Lower 48 states,"" which means that we have many good medical options, but not all the ones a less remote place would have.  There is literally one geriatric specialist MD in the area.  So a mental health hospital (there's only one in town) isn't going to have a geriatric unit, per se.   

He was on seroquel and doing really well with it, but the assisted living didn't want him on it during the daytime because of the risk of sleepiness and balance issues.  Since he wasn't on lockdown, they really didn't want him taking a walk and falling as a result of the medication.  So about 2 weeks ago, his psychiatric nurse switched him over to risperidone.  Dad is now refusing to take his evening meds (they suspect because he wants to control at least one element in his life), and so he's only getting a half-dose of anything.  We think this is why he's getting so wild.  The plan is to get him to the memory care and put him back on seroquel twice a day.

And ultimately, alternate care may be what is needed so both can have living situations that best fit them. 
Look for an association that can point them in the right direction to resources in the community. If you're in the US, try the Alzheimer's Association. They can do an assessment of the family and suggest ways of getting help (even some financial).
If that's not possible, please go over and offer to care for him while she goes out to do something, like shopping, or a salon visit.

Ask the doctor about palliative care. Like hospice the goal is comfort, not cure, but is more open-ended. My father was put on palliative care when he was rejected for hospice.

0.4617,0.7997,0.0672,0.9234,0.0,"Hello everyone. Yesterday I realized that my mom is more than just forgetful. She is convinced my brother is breaking into her house and stealing from her. He lives over an hour away and is fairly successful, he wouldn't waste the gas to come here just to steal a pair of scissors. But as I'm sure all of you know, logic has nothing to do with these situations. I read through a lot of this sub &amp; will continue to do so. There's a lot I need to educate myself on. I did talk to my mom about what I see and how frightening it is, and so she agreed to get tested. I'm just wondering if there's anything I can do in the meantime to get her focus off of my brother, it is causing her horrendous stress and I suspect that it's affecting her overall health. "
0.4912,0.8508,0.0,0.9824,0.0,"Know that you aren't alone. We are with you. 

You are absolutely right that logic does nothing in these situations, this was a hard lesson for me. It super frustrating!  I would suggest keeping her entertained as I find these ""stories"" happen more often when my SO is bored. Subject changes help as well, but I find if I keep the subjected I switch to is related it helps. My SO tells the story of watching his childhood friend  hit and killed by the school bus and that can set a tone for the day and he will focus on terrible memory after terrible memory, but if I ask him about his friends sister when he tells that story he goes on and on about all the fun things they did together and it makes for a happier day. Maybe talking about funny things your brother did when you were children? 

No matter how it works out know that you are doing your best and that's all you can ask of yourself. "

0.7028,0.5028,0.0,0.5806,0.4125,"Of course SparklePantsForAll is right, but getting him to a doctor can be tricky. If he is the kind of person who ""gets enraged at the snap of a finger,"" it's best that he make that decision himself.

My husband was a sweetie pie, but still quite capable of disbelieving unpleasant facts. So what I did was contact his doctor before a routine visit, and ask the doctor to bring up the subject. He did, and my husband said he did seem a little more forgetful lately. The doctor referred him to a neurologist, and we went on from there.

Of course this might be a little more difficult for you since you are not a relative of the patient. But perhaps this is something his daughter can do? It's just a phone call. Hopefully, with your boyfriend's permission of course, the doctor's office will let you go in with your boyfriend for his consultation.

If the doctor does feel that your boyfriend needs further evaluation, do not say things like ""I knew it! You've been very forgetful lately..."" Try to keep his course of evaluation/treatment between him and his medical team, being as supportive as you can, of course. Do not point out his memory lapses or say things like ""I told you that before...""

Please read the book [The 36-Hour Day](https://www.amazon.com/36-Hour-Day-Alzheimer-Disease-Dementias/dp/1455521159). It's probably best that he doesn't see you reading it. I know this seems ""sneaky,"" but benevolent sneakiness is something that Alzheimer's caregivers soon learn."
0.2719,0.4156,0.4881,0.4798,0.032,The anger/sensitivity is a sign too. If we had gotten my dad diagnosed and on blood pressure meds a long time ago he would have been much better off. Sooner rather than later with this. Also. Record conversations or use a nanny cam if you can. 
0.5448,0.5385,0.1443,0.6218,0.2338,"Just make her comfortable. Usually people die an average of seven years after diagnosis. They may go through a fearful or aggressive period early on, but eventually that goes away too. 

Later on they won't remember much, save for the deepest memories. For awhile, my mother started speaking Italian again, that information was so deep.

Make sure legal and financial matters are in order. Find a good nursing home for the later stages. At some point you won't be able to care for her.

Eventually she will start having physical issues like urinary tract infections from sitting in diapers all the time. Finally, she won't be able to swallow, as that part of her brain deteriorates. 

I'm sorry for you and your family. Just be brave and face it head on without delusions. "

I lived with my mom and dad for the worst 5 years of her dementia slide. It was horrible, but I think I helped my parents at least some. It wasn't enough. For the 5 years after that, I lived a few blocks away and my dad finally put my mom first part time and then full time in care. I still helped whenever needed.  6 months ago, my dads heart gave out. Now my mom is starting to shut down with the end stage.   
You've got to live your life...you've got young children to enjoy. Don't miss a minute there, where you're really needed.  
I am sorry for your dad and mom and family...but if you're an ocean away or next door, there is not a lot that can help. Just be supportive in your own way. My dad wouldn't dream of putting my mom in full time care until it was just too overwhelming. He sort of had the martyr thing going on. I finally had to let him do his thing and was as supportive as I could be. 
If he's in the UK, I believe they had some progressive programs there. (Dementia friendly societies and non-profit organizations). I worked for the US Alzheimers Assoc. for a while and I studied some of their ideas. So maybe look into help for him from those organizations?
Good luck...feel free to pm me for info or to talk. "

Phone is becoming an increasingly difficult task, and the absence of 'shaming/blaming' calls has been a topic to consider. 

She has her own space/time, and I greatly appreciate you highlighting this; the need for myself to enter it.  I envision myself not preparing her for visits anymore (as a start). To just pop-by, and make that the joke of it all.  Of course I've done this tactic before, but I think it is a method to further consider.....


...... to continue to dismiss the meaningless and focus on the present.  

Mom is still the (tied for) lovliest person on Earth. And she tears up when she sees me. I love her

0.5801,0.5213,0.119,0.6019,0.2791,"I think that my father has Alzheimer's. He refuses to speak about any of his own health issues, but he got really drunk and told my sister one night that he has been diagnosed. I've also heard him say ""I have a neurological disorder"" but he quickly shut down any questions I started asking. 

He forgets names, regular words in conversations and it takes him longer to think of what he wants to say when he is speaking. 

I have no idea how to find out if he imagined his diagnosis, (he has other health problems and is disabled) or if he really was diagnosed. I know he thinks that he is protecting us by not telling us, but by the time we find out for sure, it will be too late to help in the way we can now. 

My mother has been dead for 10 years now, and we are all adults, but none of us can afford the kind of care he is going to need and I'm not sure that he would accept it anyways. 

I think about this all of the time and I don't know what to do about it or if I can even do anything at all. "
