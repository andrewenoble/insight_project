"My mom was diagnosed with it a while back. My dad passed away in February and I've moved in to take care of her, while trying to find a job in the area. My brother and I fight like cats and dogs since we both have very different ideas about certain things, and he's a control-freak a-hole who's never wrong, but enough of that. Anyway, I'm finding out things as I go along, asking questions in this subreddit, asking our in-home care provider, and reading any article I come across while searching for any particular information pertinent to whatever situation arises, and I'd be happy to compare notes as things move along. My mom's is relatively not-so-bad. Her short-term memory is sketchy and she can become confused when presented with more than a couple of things at once, but she's really good at recalling things that have happened back through the years, especially about us growing up. She'll admit that she's absent minded, but trying to convince her that it's more than that is a non-starter and isn't worth pressing since it will just result in her becoming annoyed and upset, which we don't want for her. We try to let her feel as useful and self-sufficient as possible since that's how she's always lived her life (grew up with her sisters in a famous orphanage for Chinese girls and was pretty much on her own since age 16). So, I try to let her help out as much as possible when I'm preparing dinner and she really likes doing the dishes. As for activities, she can become resistant if I tell her we're going to such and such place, so I usually tell her something vague and once we're there, she's fine with participating.

"Aricept takes a while to kick in, so I am told.

What she needs first is a urine test to check for a UTI, just in case.  (UTIs in the elderly can cause/exacerbate these symptoms, and worse.)  After that, she should probably see a neurologist for a neuropsych workup.  This will help determine what the next steps should be.

If you're not getting answers with her doctors, the short-term solution -- where the above can be accomplished -- may be to take her to a hospital with a geriatric psych ward.  Call around your local hospitals or get on Google to find one that has a *geriatric* psych ward -- because otherwise she'd be put in a generic psych unit with addicts and schizophrenics and suicidal teens.

If you're in the US, make sure that she has a health care proxy if she doesn't have one already.  You can do this paperwork at the hospital if you need to.  This allows the named person or persons to make medical decisions for her and access her health care information.  It will also allow you to discharge her ""AMA"" (""Against Medical Advice"") from the hospital if you/she are not happy with the care there.

Also, during one of her lucid moments you/your family (this is important), you probably want to have her sign a durable or springing power of attorney naming her husband Tony, you, or your sister as her ""attorney-in-fact.""  

Was she even a *little* confused or senile from time to time before the Dec. 24 incident?  The way dementia works is that there is a mental ""threshold"" or ""ceiling"" -- which can become substantially lowered (permanently) when there is some trauma.  What you describe may have been enough to do it.

If it's a UTI (which I tend to doubt from what you describe, but the urine test should be done anyway just in case because it's the easiest test to do), then antibiotics will help.

"(*Still not legal advice, medical advice, or in fact any kind of advice at all.  Ignore me.  I'm just some jackass on the Internet.  On the dumbest site on the Internet, to boot.)

Was it a neurologist who looked at the CAT scan?  I'm presuming so, but make sure.  That's important.

A neuropsych evaluation is more in-depth.  They'll go through various tests with the patient (like having them draw a complex picture then remember the picture and draw it again 20 minutes later, having them remember a list of words, having them use a word in a sentence, etc., etc., basic stuff) and they'll also be able to determine how severe the dementia is.

**Mild dementia** = keep an eye on them

**Moderate dementia** = they need someone with them 24 hours a day to provide care

**Severe dementia** = literally don't let them out of your sight

I'm assuming she's on Medicare and/or Medicaid?  If so, see if it's possible to have the hospital discharge her directly to an assisted living/nursing home/hospice care facility for dementia.  (This would also make the issue of guardianship/conservatorship moot.)  Otherwise, if that's not possible or you don't want to do that, the waiting list for that stuff Medicare/Medicaid-funded tends to take a couple of years.

Guardianship and conservatorship are both pains in the ass and can open whoever takes the reins up to all kinds of liabilities potentially.  Not saying don't do it, and definitely talk with the attorney about it, but just a forewarning.  If you go that route, you may want to have the husband as the fiduciary if he's capable, as a matter of liability, instead of you or your sister, unless there's some good reason not to.

Quick rundown of the differences so you can have talking points with your attorney (who will be far more knowledgeable and helpful than I could ever be here):

**Guardianship:** Basically, the guardian has a parent-like relationship to/duties toward the person being guarded over -- except usually doesn't include anything money-related.

**Conservatorship:** A conservator generally has total control over the person's finances, to their exclusion.  This is an option for people who cannot handle their finances at all and are so incompetent that they put their assets at risk.  (Grandma's writing too many checks to charities that prey on old people?  Time to take the checkbook away.)

**Power of attorney:** Unlike guardianship or conservatorship, a power of attorney is as simple as properly executing a form.  (I don't know what your state's laws are.  It may involve notarization.  It may involve having witnesses sign.  It may involve both.  Ask your attorney.)  A power of attorney can apply to medical issues, financial issues, or both.  It can be very very broad (even encompassing EVERYTHING) or very very narrow (""I authorize Jane Smith to act for me in negotiating and performing the sale of my apartment building at 123 Willow Street"").  The person or persons named as fiduciaries can do (and sign for) everything that the principal (in this case, your mom) can legally do -- to the extent the power of attorney document gives that power.  Sign a loan, open a bank account, create a trust, file taxes, make gifts, pay bills, sign contracts, sign checks, make medical decisions, etc. on behalf of the principal/in the principal's name (the power of attorney document has to EXPLICITLY grant these powers, generally -- especially when it comes to much more specific stuff like, say, creating a trust).

Your attorney (or even banker) will tell you this, no doubt, but it is *VITAL* when acting as someone's ""attorney-in-fact"" to sign everything with the words ""attorney-in-fact for [Principal]"" or ""power of attorney for [Principal]"" or ""POA for [Principal].""  If you just sign your name without these words, you potentially obligate yourself PERSONALLY.  Many people have made this mistake.  Don't be one of those people.

Also, unlike a conservatorship (which you typically have to go to court for, as I understand it), a power of attorney takes no power away from the principal.  The principal still has the power to do whatever, and the principal can revoke the power of attorney at any time for any reason.

**Power of attorney, DURABLE:** A durable power of attorney document is ongoing, typically until revocation or death.

**Power of attorney, NONDURABLE:** The opposite.  It lasts until a certain time or event occurs.

**Power of attorney, SPRINGING:** The power of attorney does not come into effect UNTIL an event occurs (for instance, the principal's incapacitation).  It then may be ongoing, or it may cease at a certain time.

Note that banks will often have their *own* power of attorney form that they require to allow the attorney-in-fact to do stuff for the principal related to that bank (open, close, manage accounts, sign checks, etc.), so if you do the power of attorney thing instead of a conservatorship, make sure you get a copy of and execute the bank's special form at the same time.  The bank will typically require their form, the regular power of attorney document if applicable (so they know what you do and don't have the power to do), a copy of your driver's license as attorney-in-fact, and a copy of the principal's driver's license.

The process for them to recognize a power-of-attorney or conservatorship can take a few days; make sure you deal with a branch manager because it tends to take longer otherwise.  (Branch managers have more empowerment to do things on their own.  The other ""regular"" bank representatives typically have to run everything by the bank's corporate legal department.)

That's all I can think to ramble on at the moment.  GL!

But he was already home, and my mom was right next to him. 

Or it may not be LBD, just plain old dementia. The thing is, LBD is really hard to diagnose in its early stages. When we suspected that something might be going on with my dad, we took him to the doctor and the doctor gave him a few tests to test his mental capabilities. Even though we knew that something was definitely wrong, my dad was still able to do pretty well on the tests. The doctor gave him three words, and then five minutes later asked him to recall the three words. The doctor asked him to draw a clock. Finally, the doctor asked him to start with 100, subtract 7, then subtract 7 again, and subtract 7 again. My dad was also put on Aricept. When the symptoms because more pronounced (maybe about a year later), he was put on Exelon.

1. Instead of ""I am your ***daughter***!"", something else, like ""I'm ***married***!""  (Regardless of whether or not it's true.)

But the ""daughter"" aspect is pretty dramatic, dramatic enough, maybe, to involve a part of his brain that *can* remember, and if he *does* manage to remember, it'll only make him feel awful that he did such a thing.

1. I don't know if such a thing is ever considered ethical, and I don't know if the dementia has progressed to the point where your mom and dad no longer have a physical relationship.  But it's possible to minimize, dampen sex drive with medication.  You'd have to ask his Dr., or have your mom ask his Dr. if such a prescription would be a possibility for your dad.
