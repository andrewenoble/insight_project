"Nursing home administrator here. Why don't you see if the facility can help with transport? If they are making 5k-6k per month off your Medicaid, it would be worth the investment of a few hundred dollars. Typically they will let a family member ride with them as well.




Regarding moving stuff in, you'll want to check with the admissions coordinator. They will go over furniture and moving things in when you fill out an admission's packet. Typically they will just want to make sure there is room for what you want to bring (especially if it's a semi-private room), and make sure that nothing breaks their fire code. Also, they will hopefully make sure you know that they do not take responsibility for his belongings, so it could potentially be a big gamble if he brings laptops, ipads, etc.


For decorations, pictures, and music that he holds sacred, are some of the best things. Make the place feel as much like home, and as little like a nursing home as possible, and make sure he has your numbers written down in case he ever wants to call.

"My mum has vascular dementia. This sounds somewhat similar to what she has been through although I think my mum's symptoms started at 70 ish, she's now 85ish.  I noticed she was having problems approx. 10 - 15 years ago but had a hard time convincing anyone else and my Dad was in denial. I think it was written off as the eccentricities of getting older. The plateaus sound just like her in the earlier stages, as does the inappropriateness (well, closer to being downright rude), paranoia, withdrawal etc. She'd also get annoyed if she wasn't the centre of attention quite a bit, and cause a fuss. 

She became quite aggressive, but this would be completely out of the blue. She'd be smiling, and then you'd get a kick, or a punch, or an ashtray to the head. She'd also talk to things not there and stamp on imaginary bugs.

I think she has not recognised me for around 3-4 years. 
She has lost the coordination to feed herself etc in the last year or so. She had bouts of incontinence mainly when ill in the last few years but in the last year or so has become completely incontinent. 

She chatters constantly. Some days it is obviously English words but not in any understandable order and so makes no sense. Sometimes it sounds like gobbledegook. My Dad answers her but I have never had the nerve to ask him if he actually understands her as understandably he's very sensitive about it. They've been married over 65 years. I can't imagine how it feels to see the person you love deteriorate like this. 

She has been living in a care home for 2 years after she got so aggressive with my dad she pretty much beat him up. He's too old to look after her. 

I'm in the Uk so treatment etc may be different but am happy to answer any questions. Her VD was confirmed with an MRI if I recall correctly, it was some time ago.

"Hi! My father has had Alz/dementia for the past 3 years. I came to a point where I could cry and worry about what could happen in the future OR I could take each day as it comes while preparing for the worst. In other words, worry about tomorrow, tomorrow. There are some days I'm immobilized by fear and worries, I don't even want to get out of bed. That doesn't work out too well, partly because I'm his caretaker.  

So, my motto is, ""One day at a Time."" Sometimes this turns into, ""One hour at a time."" This doesn't mean I'm not planning for what may come or avoiding the situation (ie. I'm still applying for medicaid, helping my mom get guardianship for him, getting the medicine he needs, etc.). Even so, I still have my good cry once in awhile where I feel overwhelmed either by where he's at or where he's going. Imagining putting my dad in a nursing home is very hard for me. So I've learned to stay away from those thoughts while doing my best to make it possible for him to live in his home as much as possible. If it comes to the point he may have to go in a nursing home, I have a plan (working on a plan) on how we will handle it on a practical and on an emotional level (who I'll seek help from), but otherwise I don't think about it and tell myself to deal with it when and if it happens.

Even the smallest effort of healthy distractions have helped me a lot. I've watched my fair share of Korean dramas, puzzles, keeping an online journal, listening to books on tape or guided meditation to go to sleep etc. Helped keep my mind focused on other things. 

I have also found a lot of support from relatives and either older friends or my parents' friends. I'm surprised by how many people either know somebody, or have a family member with some type of dementia. Just not that many people my age who can relate.

"This is similar to the phase where we broke down and put my mom into a nursing home. Once she was in there we were honestly mad that we had waited as long as we had. It felt like keeping her at home with us was the best thing for her but once she was in a place that was designed for her needs and staffed by people who were trained to care for her she became much happier - and my dad finally could have some semblance of normalcy.
I don't know if your mom is getting violent but my mom was really physically hurting us. When we came back to the house after taking her to the home for the first time I could really feel how on guard we were, like there was always a wild animal in the house.

Long story short, if it's an option - encourage your dad to look into memory care facilities. One thing that I had to remind my dad was that if the roles were reversed she would have been forced to put him in a home much sooner simply because he would've been able to overpower her once he became irrational.

Has she be displaying any other behaviors that are out of the norm for her? I have attached a list of Mild (Early Stage) Alzheimer's.


Mild Alzheimer's disease (early-stage)
 
In the early stages of Alzheimer's, a person may function independently. He or she may still drive, work and be part of social activities. Despite this, the person may feel as if he or she is having memory lapses, such as forgetting familiar words or the location of everyday objects.

Friends, family or neighbors begin to notice difficulties. During a detailed medical interview, doctors may be able to detect problems in memory or concentration. Common difficulties include:
•Problems coming up with the right word or name 
•Trouble remembering names when introduced to new people 
•Having greater difficulty performing tasks in social or work settings 
•Forgetting material that one has just read

"My granny is early is this stage. This past spring and early summer I would call her weekly and we could chat for 45 minutes. Then she got sick. The doctors still aren't calling it anything, but she has lesions on her frontal lobe that aren't cancer, tumors, strokes, or infection. It's been going on 4 months. It's some form of dementia and we don't know what. I spent the last couple days with her and it is hard seeing her... She's so sweet, but she looks right through you. She told me I was her sister in law, which was actually good because she said some words. 
My husband lost his grandmother after years of Alzheimer's, and he reminds me that I need to remember the good times with her. The times when she was herself, so after she's gone I din only remember the empty times.

"Sorry, but I did giggle at the flipping people off bit. My mum went through a period of really swearing at people - horrific abuse. Thing is, I've never heard her swear in her life before. I was even surprised that she knew some of the words.

My mum was never much of a very nice person. I think I have never actually said that before. My dad acts like she was perfect, and I think there has been some rewriting of history going on. I sometimes wonder whether I am the only person who remembers what she was actually like. 

The bugs/hallucination have been in the last 5 years or so. 

It's interesting to me - may not be to anyone else - that my mum has been a big smoker for 70 or so years. It's only in the last year of having her brain fried by this condition/disease that she has stopped craving cigarettes. She stopped recognising me years before. 

Edi because I didn't think to say this at the time: 

One of the reasons the doctor thought my mum had vascular dementia rather than one of the other forms was because her deterioration was in steps ie. maintain behaviour for x months and overnight it changes to something worse...then maintained for a while, then suddenly it changes again.

So the thought was that the changes were being caused by mini strokes rather then a gradual deterioration, and the scan (I think MRI) confirmed it.",,,,orphanb,,,1453293203,t5_2rfqf,t3_41obj9,t1_cz53gej,2,1454610370,0,0,cz54681,dementia,2,,

So what you have to do now is concentrate on yourself and make sure you're not dragged down with the disease. Sometimes you'll get angry about the whole deal, but the #1 thing to remember is it's not your grandad you're angry at - it's the disease. That's really really hard to do, but it is the key. You have to change your own mindset. 

If it just gets too damn much go see your doctor. Be very frank about your feelings and tell them you need help. Your doctor may put you on some pills to help that and may know a therapist that can help. I fought against the pills and it was a huge mistake. I fought against getting the therapist and that was an even bigger mistake. 

But the biggest takeaway is that it has to be about you now. There's nothing you can do for your grandad except try and love him.

All the wonderful advice in this thread is making me think that we should get him distracted for the day, move his stuff (we've already decided what pieces are being moved) with a rental/borrowed car and then take him there in the evening, perhaps in the company of a more authoritarian friend of his, and then SIL can stay or not, depending on his reaction. 

He's very independent and strong-willed, so I'd actually be worried for SILs safety.

"Be strong, it's tough.

And support your mom. She needs it more than you know.

So sorry... I'm dealing with it too, but right now, it's about keeping mom sane. She needs a LOT of help mentally. 

Do you have siblings that can help? She probably needs a break... like a looong break. It's hard to see her life partner deteriorate... as well as you thinking of it as the child of your dad. 

I go home every weekend to spend time with my mom to give her a mental break from the, well, the monotony of the day to day. I also bring puzzles, word finds, anything I can find to keep my dad stimulated. 

My fiance doesn't get it and when I talk about my dad, he says I'm exaggerating. And that hurts. Like I'm trying to make something worse than it is. But when he comes over, my dad will shake his hand for a while, until I say, ""You know XX"". And then he gets all offended and is like, ""of course!""

Also, I'm marrying XX in 3 weeks. 

Be strong for you and your mom and, as much as it sucks, listen to her tears and her concerns and help her guide herself to a future. 

It will get worse, and no one will get it but you, but you have to be strong and be smart. 

Everytime I see my dad, he knows me. He doesn't know my mom, but he knows me. 

He called me his brother's name once, and asked where I was. It hurt a lot. More than I thought. Be ready, but also be there.",,,,coco719,,,1453443366,t5_2rfqf,t3_40inne,t3_40inne,1,1454653162,0,0,cz7i6e1,dementia,1,,

"You did fine considering the circumstances, but here are a couple suggestions:

The common advice I've heard for this kind of situation is to tell him that his wife has run some errands and she'll be back soon, or has gone to see a family friend for a couple of days (of course, if the wife is sitting right there, she has to cooperate with the idea or all hell will break loose).  This concept also works well if the spouse has passed away.  It's a kinder approach than reminding the remaining spouse every.time.they.ask that their wife/husband has passed as the news feels fresh to them every time and brings on grief all over again and again and again... 

As far as requests to ""go home"", many times, when dementia patients are asking to do that, it's not necessarily to the home that they just lived in but it's actually their childhood home.  They know something is wrong and are searching for the place *and the people* (i.e. Mom/Dad) that provided the most comfort to them.

There have been adult kids who actually take their parents back to visit the old homeplace just to have them get upset because the people they want to see there are, of course, long gone.  The picture is incomplete so it provides them only confusion rather than comfort. 

You can hear more about these techniques and others by watching Teepa Snow's videos on YouTube.

"I've been there with my family - two grandparents who can't care of themselves due to dementia and disease (in my case, my grandmother had a stroke and was partially paralyzed; grandfather had dementia), and a mother shouldering all the caregiving. It can make you feel so helpless. 

One thing I wish we did is what you're doing - asking questions and looking for outside support. I think we were too proud and simply didn't know/think any resources existed out there to help us. 

That being said, it be worth getting in touch with the Lewy Body dementia Foundation (https://www.lbda.org/). They have specialists and can talk you through what resources might be available in your area to get your grandfather care at home. 

The Alzheimer's Association also has info on to get government assistance or other benefits, which your grandparents may qualify for: https://www.alz.org/care/alzheimers-dementia-costs-paying-for-care.asp

"Hello there, I am so sorry for the pain you are in and touched by your love for your grandma. I worked in a memory unit as a caregiver for two years, so I am very familiar with the scene you describe. The only thing I can say is that there are few good options. If does not seem feasible to give her round the clock care at home, as it seems the rest of your family is saying that they can't handle it anyomore. While it pains you greatly, the physical and emotional needs of the rest of the family such as your grandfather, need to be kept in mind. Keeping someone at home like that, where by your own account she was stuck in a recliner, dehydrated, not sleeping and suffering from a UTI, is arguably not a better solution than a nursing home. At least in a home, there are every 2 hour diaper/bathroom checks, frequent med passes to deal with the insomnia, agitation and depression of the residents. Also, usually snack and hydration every two hours too. Is it like a real home? No, but modern society and the ages to which people are now living, makes this type of home care increasingly difficult. You should discuss hospice care, either at a hospice center, her own facility or at your home. I cannot see protracting her life with more fluid infusions and antibiotics while she sits confused in a nursing home to be the kindest path.

"Hi and thank you for replying. I am so sorry to read about the debilitating effects this disease has had on your father. 

Honestly, my mom's symptoms are fairly different. So far, her problems seem more social, than functional, if that makes sense.  It's more like her social skills have deteriorated, she has very little interest in other people and has lost interest in most things she previously enjoyed. Her affect is just bizarre. For example upon being informed that an acquaintance had skin cancer and had to have part of their nose removed, she started to giggle. However, she never had the education or smarts to be an aerospace engineer, but I do imagine at this point she would be unable to function in any type of challenging job. She is trained as a teacher, and I highly doubt she could do that now.

"Do you mean that you're considering moving her out of the care facility and having her live with you? Whatever you decide, it should be consistent, which means that she always lives in the care facility or she always lives with you. Back when we were going through various options, I had voiced the possibility of having our mom live the work week in a facility, and having her stay with me in our house on the weekends (I didn't want her to never again sleep under the roof of our family home, which is where we're currently living). That's something that is very advised against doing since it serves to confuse the person with dementia.

Lessons I've learned after ~18 months of being my mom's live-in caregiver are:

*  Be patient. The urge will be to tell her to just think, regarding some mishap she's made happen, hoping that she'll understand and alter her behavior. It's really heartbreaking, but that isn't going to happen, and you've got to accept that.

* Divert her attention away from certain tendancies. For example, when we're doing the cleaning up chores in the kitchen (mom likes to do such things in order to feel like she's contributing), my mom goes through paper towels like you wouldn't believe. So, I've taken to hiding the paper towel roll, and setting aside and laying (rationing) out clean sheets for her to use and/or directing her to a cloth towel to dry her hands. She also gets confused about which button on the TV remote to press in order to turn the TV and cable box on or off, so I've used paper to cover up all the adjacent buttons except for the one she needs to use, with arrows drawn that point to the red, ""All On"", button.

* Some times a white lie or withholding the complete truth is the best alternative. For example, I've been trying to keep our mom as engage in activities as possible. Towards this end, I take her to various activities at the senior center. Mom some times complains about having to go to a particular activity, even though she enjoys it once we're there. In order to avoid provoking irritation on her part, when we're leaving and she asks where we're going, I reply with a vague answer like we're going to run errands, and she doesn't become irate and protest about why we're making her do something.

* Try to find ways in which she can participate. I do all the cooking and ancillary kitchen chores, and when I'm doing those, mom will come into the kitchen and ask if there's anything she can do to help, so I find things for her to do, like putting the uncooked rice into the rice cooker, adding the water, and turning the rice cooker on, or snapping the woody ends off the asparagus in preparation of steaming them. We also do the dishes together (severe drought so no dishing washing machine), which entails me preparing the bins of soapy water and the rinse water, and then having her wash the dishes with me rinsing them, and, later, directing her as to where things go when we're putting everything back into the various drawers and cabinets.

"The nursing home administrator above is correct, age should not be a factor here, but unfortunately sometimes it is. My mother-in-law passed away of early-onset Alzheimer's a couple of years ago. She had a steep cognitive decline after a hospital stay and it became necessary to place her in a nursing facility. It was not easy to find an appropriate place that would accept her. In our experience (and from stories of other families we met), nursing homes are often very hesitant to accept younger residents. My mother-in-law was a very small woman who even with dementia loved to give hugs, sing, and dance. She was often happy but after her decline had periods of anger and distress. Because she was young and still very mobile, I believe nursing homes were weary that she would be more difficult to handle than an older, less active resident. We visited more than 20 facilities, and probably about a 1/3 had a very long wait list, about 1/3 we didn't feel were appropriate, and about 1/3 didn't want to accept her. Sometimes (shockingly) we were overtly told that a younger resident ""wouldn't fit in"" or that they only accepted people who are ""pleasantly confused."" Sometimes, we would get on the ""wait list"" and just never hear back even after calling and writing to the admissions staff multiple times. My husband and I are well educated professionals in our 30's and we ended up having to hire an elder care manager to help us find a good nursing home that would care for her. The place we found would not have been our first choice, but it was a good facility with caring nurses and CNA's. Our elder care manager had connections with nursing homes that were essential. Their rates are steep, but if you have the financial means, it could be useful to hire someone to help you out. If you haven't already, I would also suggest making sure you have completed an application from each nursing home, even if they have verbally told you that your mother is on the wait list.

I will say the each and every situation is different. Some people are still in the early stages of the disease and refuse to move somewhere else or have someone stay with them. They want their independence as long as possible and they so desperately need for their wishes to be respected. So you have to try your best to respect their wishes. Is it an ideal situation? No, but this is the situation you find yourself in through no fault of your own or the person with Alzheimer's. Calling APS could be the cruelest thing to do this this gentlemen. He may not have much money for in-home care. Like I said, every family situation is different, and everyone is doing the best they can do.

"The OP says his grandfather is in his own house, and they want to monitor him remotely, which means, from outside the home. He is also not well enough to leave on his own, and is doing it repeatedly.

If *you* are unsure of the situation, why would you recommend confusing his grandfather about how to get out? Wouldn't you want to ask first about the particulars before recommending something like that? What if there's only one exit, the man is home alone, and he has progressed to the point where he shouldn't be left alone? Would you still think putting a decal on the exit door was a good idea? So, without knowing, why would you suggest it, or *at least* provide a caveat that it should not be done in a situation like I have described?

&gt;you pointed out earlier you wouldn't lock a child in a house just like i would imagine you wouldn't let a child walk the streets.

The choice is not between locking them up alone, or setting them free in the streets. There is a third choice, which is to provide appropriate supervision. I wouldn't let a child walk the streets, **nor** lock (or even leave) them alone in the house. 

There are other options for supervising an adult with dementia. These include: hiring caregivers, enlisting family members and friends, seeking social services such as adult day care and home care for when one cannot be there, moving the person in with a family member, assisted living, and nursing home care. 

People have to come to grips with the fact that even though a person with dementia is an adult, and can sometimes engage in rational thought processes, there comes a time when one's situation is unsustainable without additional caregiver help. Locking someone in is not a substitue for providing appropriate care for them. If someone is at the point where they are leaving their house on their own in a confused state, it is time to explore these options. Locking someone in unattended is a convenience for the adult child/main caregiver. It is not in the best interest of the person with dementia.

Seeing the big changes after we stopped AD medication, his doctor suspected my father have CJD instead, but a rare sort that keeps him alive after this many years. There are little treatment for CJD too, so the doctor conceded the ""treatment"" that seem to work so well now for him is as good as any.

"It's hard and, though it is a degenerative disease, I think you will have an easier time coping as time goes on. When I first found out my dad had early onset alzheimers, I didn't want to acknowledge the reality of the situation and, admittedly, I kind of avoided him for a couple months. Luckily my stepmom handled all his appointments, etc. at this time. Since then, it has gotten a lot easier and I am, for lack of a better word, 'ready' to deal with things. It's still hard but I'm no longer so angry and resentful. (Ok, I'm still resentful at times but not like I was when we first got the diagnosis). 

We are fortunate to have great doctors and a caregiver support group nearby, both things I highly recommend. 

As for friends, I am in my mid-twenties (my dad in his mid-50s) and my friends dont get it either. They are polite and ask how he is doing but I almost hate that question, despite their good intentions. ""Oh, he's getting worse everyday, since that's what Alzheimer's does. He's depressed and has bad days. We are all anxious about the downhill spiral... Thanks for asking."" But caregiver support groups, either online or in-person, can better relate and offer advice. If you have friends who you are close with and who truly care and want to support you, just try opening up to them and don't feel pressured or rushed in doing so.

"My elder was at times combative.  There are often reasons for this:

*  She could have been molested or sexually assaulted in the past. That may make her uncomfortable with being touched in certain ways.

* She may have chronic pain from a prior injury.

* She may have dementia with lewy bodies which can involve hallucinations

* She may be startled due to hearing or vision problems.  If she's got a bad left ear or something, approach on the right.  

Elders with dementia are like crazy folks with big holes in their brains.  Quick redirects &amp; distractions help.  

Regarding the bedtime, that was a huge challenge for my elder.  Prior to being in a facility they were a super night owl like me.  That meant dinner around 8, staying up till 1 am usually, and sleeping till 10 or even 11 am.  The facility ran much earlier: breakfast prior to 8, dinner just before 5.  It didn't mesh well with their schedule.  If she's got a history of night owl behavior, or insomnia, or other things, perhaps her care plan needs to take that into account.

"There is that as well, yes absolutely. It is a terrible, protracted and undignified death for the most part. I was kind of speaking from my perspective as Alzheimer's caregiver. Definitely the illness was awful for the patients themselves. Much more so in the early-middle stages though in my opinion because they still knew what was happening to them.

"First off, I'm sorry about your grandmother. 

Acute skilled nursing can vary from OK to awful. Long-term nursing, even when it's good, is usually pretty grim.

It would be great if she could go back home with someone to stay with her 24/7. This way she can be with her husband in a familiar setting. She may be eligible for additional support such as home care nursing, PT and OT. There may be reasons why she can't go home though (meals, medical condition, safety concerns, the layout of the house).

If you're going to try to look for a better long-term care situation you first need to gather information about your grandmother's condition. If you're going to be doing this on your own you will want to ask your grandmother to sign a health care power of attorney to allow you to do this on her behalf.

Any long-term care facility is going to want to know what assistance is needed with activities of daily living (ADLs): Dressing, grooming, bathroom, getting around, eating, managing medication. The current facility probably already has such an ADL assessment and will do one again before discharging her to long-term care. You'll also need information on her medical condition: medications, chronic conditions that require regular care, etc. This is very difficult but you will need to have a frank discussion with her doctor about her life expectancy. If she's nearing the end she may be eligible for additional services through hospice, which is covered by Medicare.

You'll need to find out who is paying for long-term care and what the pool of money is. Acute skilled nursing is covered by Medicare; long-term care is not. Typically an older person has some retirement savings and/or the family will contribute money. Your grandparents may have long-term care insurance. 

Once you have this information you can start doing research. Your state (assuming you're in the US here) regulates nursing homes and assisted living; they may or may not publish information about them. My state publishes inspection reports. There are review sites, but I didn't find them helpful. Talk to friends, colleagues, neighbors who may be in a similar situation. 

Many assisted living facilities have Alzheimer's units (sometimes called ""Memory care""). Assisted living is generally not as grim as a long-term nursing home (still no picnic, though). Many can provide increasing levels of care as the resident needs it so there's no need to go to a nursing home. Again it would be ideal if your grandparents could stay together.

When my father could no longer live alone I found a dementia unit in a larger assisted living that could accommodate his then-current health needs and provide additional care as he declined. A place that looked like an apartment building, not a hospital. He was able to stay there to the end - he passed away in summer of 2015.

Sorry for the wall of text. Hopefully some of it will be helpful, and best of luck.",,,,xnedski,,,1451743443,t5_2rfqf,t3_3z40ds,t3_3z40ds,4,1454233008,0,0,cyja0ts,dementia,4,,

"Prevention is always better than cure. And one possible preventable causes is water contamination. Trace amounts of metals in our water supply, through constant exposure, eventually bioaccumulate in our bodies. Our minds work overtime to get rid of excess metals on a daily basis. Slowly but surely, our minds calcify under the burden of metal toxicity.
Once more emphasis is placed on purer water circulation, the potential for many accelerated dementia cases could diminish.
Other factors within our control, such as stress, pollution, inactivity and obesity also increase the odds of developing dementia. Simple things, like drinking tea and coffee, may have a protective effect. Green tea improves metal chelation - the binding of harmful metals into substances that the body can more readily discard. And regular coffee consumption is said to limit damage to the body on the cellular level. Drinking high silica containing mineral water is also said to reduce the content of aluminium levels in our bodies, as the silica binds to the aluminium, allowing it to be excreted.
There are treatments that can remove the amyloid tangles that form in dementia. And early intervention with these therapies look promising - but only in cases that have not already progressed far. 
Ultimately, it is the therapies that strengthen our existing defences against attack that are key.
Galvanising our minds with myelin enhancing agents, such as lithium or valproate, offer a certain amount of protection against dementia in bipolar patients.

"Project Lifesaver is a program run through many local police departments across the country. The sheriff or a deputy will fit her with a bracelet or anklet that is difficult to remove. It has a GPS in it, and if she wanders the police will be able to locate her. 

I use Pocket Finder. It's a bit chunky, about the size of the palm of your hand. Does your loved one habitually carry a certain item, like keys, or a purse? My loved one wanders too, but always brings her purse. If so, you might be able to find a way to hide or secure it to that item. Like this incident you described, it's not a foolproof strategy because they might not bring it- but it's an idea. I charge it twice weekly, and re-sew it into the lining of her purse each time. There are different power settings- to save battery, you can put it in airplane mode and just activate to tracking mode when you need to locate her. It is VERY accurate., quick and user friendly. I have used it three times to find my loved one. I think it was like $130 to buy the device, and $13/mo for a service plan. Worth it. We will keep it until my loved one is immobile/bed bound.

At this stage in the disease, please be aware that all sharp items should be locked up safely.

"Well, I had a rocky relationship with my mom.  She died  of alzheimers in 2011.  This is what I think of when I see you mentioning that you've had a rocky relationship with your dad.

Until I was in my 40's or so, I went back and forth between 

**A**) Being happy because we were ""finally"" getting along, 

**B**) Trying to ""talk it out"" after she did something callous and thoughtless, and 

**C**) Re-committing my self to not getting trapped into believing yet again that we were finally on the same page.

I think it's pretty much human nature to want a close, companionable relationship with our parents.

I also think with some parents, that is never going to happen.

(You might check out /r/raisedbynarcissists - it may not be like what the problems were with your dad, but can't hurt to take a look-see...)

Anyway, as the years went by, I was more and more decided that the only real answer to how things were with my mom was to stick with option **C** - Easier said than done, right?

But over time I got better at it.  I'd say there were two ""key concepts"" that, with practice, helped me.

1. Realize that the goal ***isn't*** to not care - It's only human to want that good relationship, and to be sad if experience shows us that it's not going to happen.  But being sad doesn't mean you have to keep beating your head against the wall when experience shows that nothing you do is going to ""fix"" it.
1. Use a technique they call ""self talk"" to help yourself deal when things are rocky.  Basically, you keep a little monologue going in your head, along the lines of ""Ok, ok, there he goes, he's being a dick again, nothing I did makes him act this way, nothing I go can make him act better, that's just the way he is, yeah, I feel kind of shitty about it, but it's not my fault, it's not because of me""...  Well, you get the idea, you'd know better than I do what to say to yourself that fits the situation.

Well, I don't know if this helps any, could be your situation is not enough like mine was for this to be a useful way to deal.

But the bottom line, for me, was ""Ok, part of me wants to see this like Yeah, her mind is going, now things are never going to get ""fixed"" between us"" - But really, it never *was* going to get ""fixed"" - I wasn't losing anything, because I was never going to have that in the first place.

And in reality, as her mind declined, we had some nice times.  You didn't have to walk on eggshells, because she didn't understand enough to get offended, but she still liked flowers, and petting the cats, stuff like that, so you could share a smile, uncomplicated by having to be ""shields up"" all the time in case she decided to go on a tear...

(One thing that really helped, it seems, is appropriate psychiatric medication - That doesn't necessarily mean sedatives (though that might be part of the solution), anti-depressants and anti-psychotics are often tried out, to find treatment that helps a person be less agitated, aggressive, paranoid, etc.  If you want to read up, google for ""psychiatric medication dementia"", or ""anti-psychotic dementia"", etc.  Possibly this would be a way you can help both yourself and your mom?  Sometimes people are very reluctant to go that route, but if you get all ""in the know"", maybe you can help your mom see how and why it could be worth exploring...)

Anyway, good luck...",,,,calicoan,,,1452568256,t5_2rfqf,t3_40inne,t3_40inne,2,1454433432,0,0,cyuvd8v,dementia,2,,

"A lock box (like the fire proof kind you can use for documents) might work, so your FIL can still access those things when needed (knives, scissors, meds etc).

I'm sorry to hear all this. My loved one has gotten agitated and physical with me twice. I made myself a ""three strikes"" deal- if she lays a hand on me ever again, I'm done and out. I think sometimes it's hard to admit when we, as caregivers, are in over our head. I actually stepped way back and now only see my LO 1-2x/week, and it's been a huge relief to my mental and physical health. Maybe your FIL needs to make a similar deal, draw some sort of line- he does not have to live with physical abuse, whether the abuser is of sound mind or not. She can't necessarily help or control how she's behaving, but he doesn't have to suffer as well. There have been many, many instances in which the person with dementia and/or the caregiver have both suffered serious physical harm, as a result of agitation/violence, stress, and an unsafe environment. I think sometimes the best, kindest thing to do is admit when it's too much. For what it's worth, the top reasons for someone to be placed in memory care are: agitation &amp; violence, wandering and incontinence. 

If her behavior has changed or gotten much worse quickly, it is absolutely worth getting her checked for a UTI. UTIs are common with dementia because they tend to not wipe properly, and the infection can wreak all sorts of havoc. It's a very well known connection to behavioral disturbances and violence in dementia. It can really add a lot of confusion and paranoia, and sudden behavioral changes. It might also just be how the disease will progress for her. 

 I know you said they don't have health insurance right now, but it's past the time for medication. He can call 911 or bring her to the emergency room if it gets bad, and they will have to treat her. If he refuses to bring her home, then they have no option other than to keep her, or they can send her to a geriatric psychiatric unit which will stabilize her with medication. If they are having financial difficulty, she might be eligible for Medicaid, which is actually a good thing with dementia. Medicaid covers the cost of long term care in a nursing home/memory care facility. 

There's no easy answers. ((Hugs)) I belong to a wonderful support group on Facebook that you guys should check out, especially your FIL if he uses a computer.

She was diagnosed two years ago, but is not on medication currently because at the time she refused it and no one has brought it back up since. Now they realize this was a mistake, but what's done is done and we need to start the process over again. 

Her children are very against having her anywhere besides home, but this is something I am going to discuss personally with her husband as I think he has a more realistic view of what the future holds. I will certainly urge him to go back over the house and make sure any thing that can pose a threat is hidden away in the meantime. 

I appreciate the advice. When they go to see the doctor I will ask my husband to speak with the doctor about the specific type of dementia she has. I do know they were told it could be hereditary.

"Actually, dementia can be reversed and even cured in some instances. From the [NIH website](http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dementias/detail_dementia.htm):

&gt;##Reversible Dementias

&gt;Many conditions that cause dementia can be reversed with the appropriate treatment.

&gt;* **Cerebral vasculitis**, an inflammation and necrosis (tissue death) of blood vessel walls, can cause a form of dementia that may resolve when the person is treated with immune suppressants.

&gt;* Some studies have shown that people with **depression** are at increased risk of developing dementia. Severe depression can cause dementia and can be treated.

&gt;* **Infections** can cause confusion or delirium due to related fever or other side effects associated with the body’s response to a foreign entity.

&gt;* **Metabolic disorders of the nervous system**, such as mitochondrial disorders, leukodystrophies, and lysosomal storage diseases, can lead to dementia.

&gt;* **Metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities** such as thyroid problems, low blood sugar levels (called hypoglycemia), and low or high levels of sodium or calcium also may also cause dementia.

&gt;* **Normal pressure hydrocephalus** is an abnormal buildup of cerebro- spinal fluid in the brain. Elderly individuals with the condition usually have trouble with walking and bladder control before onset of dementia. Normal pressure hydrocephalus can be treated or even reversed by implanting a shunt system to divert fluid from the brain.

&gt;* **Nutritional deficiencies** of vitamin B1 (thiamine), caused by chronic alcoholism, and vitamin B12 deficiencies can be reversed with treatment.

&gt;* **Paraneoplastic syndromes** (a group of symptoms that may develop when substances released by some cancer cells disrupt the normal function of surrounding cells and tissue) can cause symptoms that resemble dementia. Such symptoms generally occur in people with cancer when the body’s immune response to the cancer also ends up targeting proteins in the central nervous system. In many cases, the neurologic condition occurs before the cancer is detected. Circulating antibodies against brain proteins are common in both neurologic and cancer conditions.

&gt;* **Side effects of medications or drug combinations** may cause dementias that arise quickly or develop slowly over time.",,,,JustMeRC,,,1454103939,t5_2rfqf,t3_4369b9,t1_czfz8lt,1,1454815295,0,0,czgw6va,dementia,1,,

"None.  I was told by a PhD that is a scientist working to find ways to treat, slow down, and hopefully one day cure dementia, that none of the medications on the market today work. What they do is improve cogitative function briefly (a few months, and no more) while the underlying disease still progresses. In other words, if they take the drugs, their cogitative ability will briefly and slightly improve, but when the drugs stop working, in a short amount of time, they will be the same as if they never took the drugs. The disease will still have progressed.  The information out their for the current drugs available are very misleading. I have been a caregiver for a long time and I have never seen the drugs works like they say. They say,"" (Drug name) MAY slow down the progression of the disease"". The word MAY is the hook. It gives people what I call ""Hope in a Bottle"". It's a very profitable business.

&gt;I am curious. Are any of these meds successful cognitive enhancers for non sufferers of dementia?

These drugs supposedly attack the proteins that cause the plaques and tangles in the brains of people with dementia. Young or healthy people do not have a build up of plaques and tangles that cause dementia. So I would have to say NO. I would imagine these drugs could be dangerous to the brains of healthy people. However, I am not a doctor. You may want to ask this question in r/askdoc.

"&gt;Will her cognition fall off a cliff despite the Aricept all of a sudden?

I cannot say for sure how your mom with progress (suddenly or slowly), but It has been my experience, they do not just suddenly fall off the cliff. Most of the people I have seen will start to slowly go down again without any rebounds. 

My mother was diagnosed 3 years ago. At that time, the best we could tell she was at a stage 4. We had her put on the Exelon patch. For the first year on Exelon, I feel as though she teetered back and forth between stage 4 to early stage 5. But, for the past few months, all I have seen is just a slow downward progression. I would say now she is getting close to a late stage five.

&gt;Like so many things we do, to forestall the inevitable, to scratch out every faint hope to spend just one more quality second with our loved ones. Even when the larger calculus of someone's life points to an unhindered end being the best thing for all concerned.

I total agree. I would even go one further and say it is for our own selfishness. We are thinking about ourselves, not our loved one's. From what I have experienced and witness, in my heart, I am starting to believe this is ethically wrong. However, dementia patient's are presently guinea pigs for (hopefully) future medical advancement. But, is this justification?

It is my understanding from the original post, that the OP is talking about ways to monitor his grandad, when he's home alone. If I am misunderstanding, then I apologize. I was responding to suggestions made within this context.

However, there is a reason that it is *illegal* to lock a person with dementia in their home and leave them alone in many countries, no matter what stage of their disease. If a person does not have resources, in the U.S., they can get Medicaid benefits which will pay for assisted living and some home care (in some states) and nursing home care in all. My MIL is in a very nice nursing home that is covered by Medicaid. She received home care assistance through Medicaid when she was still able to be alone at home.

I'm guessing that the OP is in the UK, or Australia, as indicated by the use of the word ""mum."" Australia subsidizes care, depending on what one can afford, and I believe coverage is provided in the UK under the NHS.

"We just recently moved my dad into a memory care unit which has a door alarm if you try to leave.  The staff there said that it was better to move everything in first and have the room set up with familiar things , then bring my dad.  They suggested planning to visit frequently at first so that he wouldn't feel like he was being abandoned.  In reality, we weren't able to get more than the essentials (bed, dresser, recliner) and not really much wall decor before we moved him in just because of circumstances.  They prefer not moving things after the resident arrives so that the transition isn't confusing or stressful to them with people coming and going and their personal space changing all the time.  I think it made my dad unsettled.  
My dad wasn't angry but rather confused and we just explained that the place he was going was going to help him get his meds on time and make sure he could get exercise, etc. he really liked that there was a nurse on-call and in the unit all the time.  I think he didn't think he was being taken care of before so that was a big sell.  He still thinks that when he gets better that he can move in with us.  

It won't be easy, but it will be much better after he settles in.  The staff at our place said that for the most part, residents stop wanting to get out after a few months or less because everything is familiar and doesn't change too much.

Does the SIL expect to actually stay in the room or just nearby?  You should check with the facility about staying there.  Sometimes they have a guest room available.  They might have a policy against staying in the room with the resident.

Moving in could take a while.  I'm not sure you can move his stuff and move him in on the same day.  If its just furniture maybe.  I don't know if staff is allowed to help with the furniture so you'll need someone to help with that.  There are a few things that might help if you have time and money.  There are companies that specialize in moving elderly people into homes and they can move the stuff and set it up in a familiar way for your FIL.  Then you'd only have to get him there.  The other thought I had was if he was willing to stay overnight at some family member's house, it would give you more time to move his things and rake care of any paperwork and then move him the next day.  

I don't know what to say about telling him or not.  I think it helped for my dad to know that he was moving but my mom was also moving with him (she's in the independent living section), so it was them moving to live near us and to some degree he understood that he wouldn't be in our house.  I've read that it is better not to say anything too.  Not sure if the facility would have advice on that.  It might help to ask them what has worked.  

Good luck!  It is stressful at first but will get much better.  It would also be helpful for anyone visiting him there to read about how to talk to dementia patients because they ask questions that can be hard to answer.  Maybe you all are already well versed in that.  Also be sure to visit often to make sure the facility is living up to what they say they'll do.  Ours was awesome on the surface but then experienced a staffing shortage and they slipped a bit for a few weeks.  Luckily it was temporary and we were on top of them to improve things.  (Like pee on the floor of bathroom not getting cleaned up, not making sure my dad had a shower 2x a week minimum, one pill he wasn't getting....)

I had gotten some names of companies when we were trying to find a mover for my dad.  I can send those if you want to look into that route.  They might be local to me (I can't remember) but they might know of other companies or a branch where you are.

We've also installed doors that have locks on the INSIDE. So we can lock him IN. ",,,,elsynkala,,,1452960737,t5_2rfqf,t3_418o4e,t3_418o4e,-1,1454530101,0,0,cz0gsi1,dementia,-1,,
"Do you know for sure what type of dementia she has?  I have been reading about Lewy Body Dementia and it sounds like the drugs really do have an effect on the quality of life of someone with dementia and can help lessen some of this behavior if they are correctly diagnosed and given the corrects medication.  At least one of you should read about the medications and get to know it and any changes in her behavior to make sure its going ok.  Doctors rely on accurate representations of the patient's behavior.  My father was never put on a memory medication for 5 years and is only now getting it.  They also changed his meds to reflect Lewy Body dementia rather than Parkinson's and its really made a huge difference.  
My other advice though if improved medication does not cut it is to get her to a place where she will be safe.   ",,,,i_did-it,,,1452743517,t5_2rfqf,t3_40q94l,t1_cywjrx1,1,1454479313,0,0,cyxj3vr,dementia,1,,
"Hello again! Yes, it's actually harder to discern the demented person from the non-demented person when their personality was somewhat disturbed or not very nice before. The lines when the dementia started and when it was just unpleasant personality become blurred. My dad is also rewriting history. I let him do it because it's got to be sad enough for him. Glad the hallucinations are a later development (though not glad that she has to deal with that). I hope we don't have anything like that for a while. 

Re the smoking: I used to be a caregiver for Alzheimer's patients, and this is actually fairly common. At some point they forget they are addicted to cigarettes and can quit smoking quite easily. The same with foods that they didn't like to eat or refused before. People always found it odd when their formerly health-nut/slim mom was suddenly demanding to eat the cookie dough out of the mixing bowl and that kind of thing. 

At the times of the behavioral changes over the years, did you ever notice any evidence of mini strokes? I'm aware that these are ""silent,"" not like regular strokes, but they can sometimes show an obvious effect on people in the immediate time after. Thanks again.
