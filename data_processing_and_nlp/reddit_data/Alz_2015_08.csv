"I have found that when presented with a week's worth of pills all at once, they can overdose, i.e. take more than one day several time in the same day. I found a container that looks like the weekly pill container but each day's pills are in pods that pop out. That way I can only take out a specific day and set it out without having to worry about my wife taking more than one day. Hope that makes sense. I found these containers in a grocery store but not all carry them so you may want to be on the lookout for them.

1) Not just have power of attorney, but use it. Send it to anyone and everyone. Set up automatic bill pay and manage things for your mom &amp; dad if he will let you. One less thing for them to worry about. Of course paranoia is huge with this disease so that may be an issue. 
2) If you have the extra cash, don't just hire a maid, find someone a housekeeper who has experience with caregiving. If your mother has a friend group her age, you could ask them or your fathers friends. Chances are by word of mouth someone in that group has or knows of someone who doesn't just clean but will do little extras like... cook a meal, go through the mail, set her pills up for the week etc. Even if its just two give your dad a few hours of rest once in a while. 
3) Visit when you can. If you visit you can provide support for your father, spend time with your mother, and take care of her for small amounts of time. If you alternate with your other brother then that's great.

Don't try to correct or change her behavior. Just love her and reassure her. Give her a hug when she's upset. Don't be upset with her. When you're frustrated, smile. Don't grimace or reprimand. They feel the emotion and it makes theirs that much worse. 

I know your battle and I'm sorry. 

Edit to add. 

Help her into the shower. 
Use a shower chair and a shower wand. 
Let her keep her modesty by using an extra towel while in the shower. Only expose the parts as they need to be washed. It's only a few extra towels in the laundry in the grand scheme of things.

"I'd like to see this redone with more than 21 people. Interesting study, not surprising results though. The fact that struck me most is that, in the general population, males are more likely to successfully commit suicide, but less likely to discuss suicidal ideation and in this article it was noted that males were more likely to murder/suicide their way out of a care facility. 

Personally, I have joked with my parents about how they better kill themselves if they get sick when they're old or I will. My dad agreed, my mom looked horrified. My dad and I care for my grandma, we both are much more comfortable with death than my brother or mother.

"Learning more about the disease will help increase your patience. 
A couple of quick tips:
1. Depending on the stage he's in he might not be able to read/understand/comprehend the notes. He might understand the words in the moment, but as soon as he turns around the words might disappear from his mind. If he comprehends and retains them now, that's great. But that ability might disappear at any point. 
2. When he gets upset, battle his moods with your own smiles. He's afraid and getting paranoid. Just be gentle with him. It's not you he's angry at. It's his own memory. He doesn't know where his wife is, and that's scary. If he gets scared and sad and worried and anxious, just hug him, hold his hand, grip his shoulder - a solid touch is very reassuring to Alzheimer's patients. 
3. If he begins accusing you of moving things, stealing things, taking things - do not argue with him. You can not win that argument. Just try to keep track of where he hides/hoards his stuff and help him go through it so you can find it with him. (My mom accused my 10 year old son of stealing money from her because it was no longer in her purse. A week before I had watched her out it in her nightstand so I had an idea of where to start looking for it. I guided her to the nightstand and suggested various places to look. When she found it she gave my son a hug.)
4. Make sure he doesn't have access to keys. 
5. If he's prone to wandering then make sure his name and a phone number or address is on and in everything he wears and carries. 
6. If you go out with him, take a picture of him when you get to your destination. Every time. It's so easy to forget what he's wearing when you're in a panic because he's wandered off. 

If anything else comes to mind I'll let you know. 

Oh, get some sort of alarm or security system so you know if he's trying to leave the house in the middle of the night. It's likely to happen before you think he's 'at that stage'.

"Our pharmacy packages still the medications in daily am and pm doses.  They are labeled with the date and time the meds are to be taken.  It is simple enough that my mom is able to follow along when thou she is preferred advanced and lost in most other daily affairs.  It was not something she wanted to try at first, but I insisted she must.  It's the best thing I have done because the whole pill thing was making me crazy!  Once a month I talk to the pharmacy, we make any changes needed, and they fill everything for the month.  The only problem comes in if there are changes, then it gets tricky.  So far we have only had to add meds so it was manageable.  If her dr wants to drop some it will have to wait until the end of the month.

"Is she living at home? The best advice I can think of is to hide what high-sugar snacks she has and keep the fridge loaded with fruits, yogurts, and healthier snacks. I'm staying with my SO and his 91 year old grandfather who's been struggling with Alzheimer's for a few years, and one thing I've learned is that Pop loves ice cream. A box of six ice cream sandwiches is gone in a night. We've since hidden a small mini fridge in the garage (underneath a shelf and covered, so he won't find it) and keep a limited supply of ice cream in the kitchen for him to grab. This way we're not buying a box of ice cream every other night, but we still have ice cream when he's craving it.

"It will always be hard. After a while he should get used to your presence (might take a few months). Non verbal cues and intent are very important (what are you thinking when you interact with him). Remember that he is extremely bewildered and confused. There is still an ability to use logic but an incapacity to build a logical argument because there is no short term memory. Explanations have to be plausible and as short as possible because you have to keep repeating them. If he does not know who you are then you have to keep introducing yourself in relation to someone he recognizes (his wife and probably not his grandson, i'm a good friend of your wife here to take care of you). Not sure how much leaving explanatory notes will help. Never argue always reassure, all very hard to do.
