"If there’s one thing I’ve learned from my multiple dealings with my great uncle Dain (a sexual predator who threatened the purity of young schoolchildren all across town), it is that it is absolutely disgraceful to treat yourself as some sort of hate-sponge, where you just suck it all up and turn the other cheek.  No one sings songs of praise for the spineless punching bags of the world.  Tell your sad sack of shit of a father that he’d better shape up and be fucking quick about it or his ungrateful ass is going to end up alone in a rural ditch with the cockroaches and rats.  Even the goodliest of souls have their limits, and if you continue putting up with his hateful bullshit you run the very high risk of suffering his corrupting influence and eventually reciprocating it with your own children.

"Firstly, I am so sorry you are struggling with this. I am a dementia specialist carer completing a degree in Dementia Studies in the UK, I will try to answer your questions as thoroughly as I can.

Please excuse the wall of text, I'm on my phone. 

Progression: It's likely that due to her vascular dementia she is continuing to have what are known as TIA'S, which is a ""transient ischemic attack."" This is basically a mini stroke and could be behind the quick deterioration. Alzheimers disease progresses steadily instead of in steps. A vascular dementia will be like going down in steps, and can happen over a few days or a few years. 

Diagnosis: whilst this is not the nicest fact, it's true. The only way to 100% diagnose a dementia is via an autopsy of the brain. When a doctor diagnoses a dementia, it is not set in stone. So far the vascular dementia diagnosis sounds accurate, so does the alzheimers disease. You mentioned she also talks to people that aren't there, do you mean she is talking to a person and mistaking them for someone else or talking to an empty space? If it's the latter, it is possible she has a lewy body dementia also. This can cause hallucinations and symptoms like Parkinsons disease. There are around 500 different types of Dementia. It is unfortunately very difficult to diagnose.

Medication: most medications are also available in a liquid form, and if not then in a soluble form so they dissolve in water. You can also get medication that dissolves in the mouth, speak to your mum's regular doctor about switching to liquid or soluble medication. If it's pain relief, you can get transdermal patches (usually either fentanyl or buprenorphine). These are basically plasters that stay on for between 3-7 days and release a certain hourly dose of pain relief that is absorbed through the skin.

Her mood: with dementia one of the most difficult things is often that the person cannot express themselves anymore. Think of your mum like an iceberg (weird but hear me out) what you see is what is above the surface  (crying or being angry) and that's her way of communicating to you that something is wrong. Below the surface, that's where the problem is and unfortunately you can't see it. It could be something like needing the toilet, pain, feeling sick, shoes being too tight, discomfort, not hearing well, not seeing well, things being in the wrong place, frustration as she doesn't know what to do, she's tired. It's mostly about trial and error. It could be that she is experiencing depression as this is unfortunately very common in people living with a dementia, especially alzheimers disease. Medication like fluoxitine or citalopram (which are available in liquid form) can help.

Stages of dementia: the link is not very accurate. Everyone's experience of Dementia is intrinsic to them, no one else will experience it the same way. Generally stages are referred to as ""early"", ""middle"" or ""late"".

Dizziness: if by bathroom you mean urinating, she may have a urinary tract infection. If you mean pooing, she could be constipated. If she is just getting dizzy when she stands, it could be an issue with her blood pressure. It could also be none of those and something else entirely.

How can you make her feel better: you will know this better than anyone else. Try things that your mum liked in the past, or really anything at all. Again it's a bit of trial and error. You may not always be able to make her feel better. It's also important to focus on what she can do, not what she can't do. If she is able to eat with her fingers instead of cutlery then great, that means she can eat independently and will give her that little bit of confidence. Try and encourage her to do as much as she can.  Try to go along with her reality. If in that moment she believes you are her brother, try not to tell her otherwise. I know it's very upsetting :(

Coping: there is no one way to cope with this. I live in the UK, and we have a couple of organisations that can help on the Internet.  Try www.alzheimers.org.uk or www.dementiafriends.org.uk. Both of these have forums and people to talk to who are going through similar things as you. 

If you have any more questions please feel free to message me and ask. If I don't know the answer I can try and point you towards organisations that do. Most importantly, remember to take care of yourself. It is extremely hard being a carer for a family member and you need to make sure you are the number one priority.",,,,elephant_8,,,1467328769,t5_2rfqf,t3_4qn31b,t3_4qn31b,4,1469410077,0,0,d4unnod,dementia,4,,

"When my father in law gets into this kind of ""loop"" (for lack of a better term), we just pick an answer (e.g. ""They'll be here in the morning so need to get a good night's sleep"") and be prepared to answer it over and over again. Sometimes my SO will adjust the answer a bit based on how my FIL reacted to the last one. We're going for whatever soothes him and seems to sit well with him. Occasionally we have some luck changing to a completely different subject, and if he's too agitated then ice cream often resets his mood.

"She's fine with her date of birth and address. For her SSN, she hasn't worked in over 3 decades so hasn't needed to recall that; my dad handled all of the financial matters. It can take her a bit of effort to recall her mother's maiden name (her mom passed away when she was a toddler and she was raised in a mission with her sisters, so that doesn't come up very often, and I didn't even know that until fairly recently). She has a more difficult time recalling various bits of information if she's put on the spot and/or if she doesn't quite understand why that information is being asked of her. She understands the general principle of banks and savings, but doesn't understand things like CDs maturing and minimum distributions for IRAs. One option is to have her physicians have her formally declared not mentally competent and have POA assigned to either my brother or me. I need to get a clearer idea of why my brother is reluctant to do that, but he mentioned something about the costs associated with that. I'll have to press him for more details on that because it seems like something that's gonna have to be done eventually.

Note that, at one point, my brother mentioned having her put into a care facility, which I consider to be the absolute last option; she's lived in our home for over 40 years and I'd like it if she doesn't ever have to live elsewhere, unless she chooses to do so, like our grandma requested way back.",,,,argyle47,,,1464806101,t5_2rfqf,t3_4lzu2c,t1_d3rra8k,2,1468742824,0,0,d3s21ao,dementia,2,,

"I work in nursing homes. I deal with dementia a lot.  

People with dementia tend to have plateaus and then they decline and then they plateau again for a bit. Especially when there's a big change in what's happening or you take them out of their usual Comfort setting it can trigger a decline.  There's been a bit of research in transfer trauma.  There's a reason old people don't like change. 

What I can say about coping is that with family members of those affected by dementia this is really where the grieving process start to happen. Your mother is no longer who she was. You may have glimpses of the past ohlf what what she wants was.  But there will be no recovery. It does not get better it's really about prolonging the life and keeping the affected as comfortable as possible.  

Whenever you are dealing with behavior the best thing you can do is meet her where she is. If she is looking for her mother do not tell her her mother is dead. Tell her that Mom is at the store or someone else is watching Mom for a bit and she gets to relax depending on what time her mind is at.  I'm a firm believer that reorienting is one of the worst things you can do because it causes the person to relive that grief every time.

Don't push yourself too hard and know where you're at your limits. You can't be a good caretaker when you're tired.  If you need help get help. Whether it be an in-home aide to help you or seeing a therapist about the stress level.

"Oh, yes. I'm very familiar with the feelings of being sneaky! It really sucks, because the change is so gradual and insidious that you can't mark the point when they have lost control. It's exacerbated by the moments of apparent lucidity.

What helped me was to frame it as maturing in reverse. She is currently somewhere around the level of a preteen. She makes sense and wants to do things, but she can't be trusted with adult responsibilities, and needs supervision. Even though she may be outspoken and will get angry; you have to view it from the perspective of someone who is looking out for her best interest and safety, when she is no longer able to do so for herself.

You'll get to the point where she is like a five-year-old and you won't feel so bad about making the decisions. Just remember what she did when the tables were turned and imagine what she would want if she were able to choose. Also, don't feel bad about not being able to keep her at home and devote your life to her care. She will be much better off in a care facility, where she can be looked after by experts and have all of her needs met.

There will be a time when you will delve into a complete fantasy life with her. Whatever she says or sees will be her reality, and you must play along. Trying to force her to remember or tell her that she's wrong will have no good result, and will cause her distress. I was recently at the facility where my FIL lives and sat with an Alzheimer's patient by the front door. We had a loop of this conversation for about 30 minutes:

Jewel (Resident, as she looks out the door): I'd walk home if it wasn't raining.

Me: Oh, yes. It's raining very hard. Best to stay here, for now.

Jewel: Yes, my house is just on the other side of the expressway. As soon as it stops raining, I'm going to walk home.

Me: It sure is raining hard. Maybe you should stay her for the night?

Jewel: I stayed here last night. I might have to stay again. But as soon as the rain stops, I'm going to walk home.

Me: That sounds like a good plan.

One minute passes, repeat conversation, over and over again.

Best of wishes to you and your family, and feel free to contact me if you need to vent or ask questions!

"Ha, you sound just like me with most other people in my life except him.  I'm getting better about it, though--I did stand up to him the night he hurt me so bad and I made it extremely clear he had done an awful thing and I wouldn't put up with it.  One of the things that really burned me is that he said it in front of my 10 year old daughter (who knows Grandpa is an asshole).  His comment was about my weight, and I have been so extremely careful to not drag home any issues or shame about bodies--skinny, fat, tall, short, etc.  So the fact that he put that down in front of her, combined with how strongly it affected me, adds to my fury about it.  It's just kind of a helpless fury though, because I cannot affect any change with him due to the dementia.

In some ways, it almost seems kinder to leave him in a ditch somewhere, because his end would come quickly.  Even though it would be awful, I don't think it's less awful than this long, lingering thing where he's miserable and he makes everyone around him miserable too.

"&gt; POA assigned to either my brother or me

That is the step that happens when the person is still competent to assign this authority.   Having an attorney draft POA paperwork is usually $200-$300.

*After* the dementia diagnosis and a competency declaration (which do not go hand-in-hand as people with dementia can function independently for a time after diagnosis), acquiring a POA is no longer legally possible.  Instead, your family would have to apply for a conservatorship or guardianship.   It's a much longer, more expensive, and more cumbersome process.  The conservator or guardian is also required to provide quarterly financial reports to the court from then on.  
  
With regard to the care facility, your Mom is protected by the Patient Bill of Rights.  Meaning that, if she doesn't want to voluntarily be there,  the care facility won't accept her.   The exception is if she has been declared incompetent and the POA, guardian, or conservator admits her.

Your Mom is like all of us in wanting to be at home until the end.  We visualize wiling away the last of our days puttering around our home and garden just to gently fade away in our own bed surrounded by our loved ones.  

Unfortunately, the path of aging and dying is rarely that peaceful or smooth.  If her home is is set up to handle her changing physical needs as she ages (wheelchair width hallways, spacious bathrooms with an easy to get into tub and shower, one level living with hard surfaces, no steps, no fall hazards), you've won half the battle.  

The other half of the battle is finding and paying for in-home caregiving for the hours needed, especially care givers familiar with memory care issues.   It can be far more expensive and less efficient for her to be home rather than a facility depending on those needs.    And, there are loads of requirements to be met if any of the caregiving expenses are to be covered by Medicare.    Plus, with age and infirmity, should she ever require IV meds or has other issues requiring a skilled nurse (versus a ""homemaker"" type of aid), in-home care will make very little sense.

Lastly, at a certain point given her dementia, safety and flight risk are huge issues, plus she isn't going to be as much aware of the difference between being in a facility versus her home.  

Caring for an aging parent is difficult, much less one with memory loss, so be open for any number of scenarios so that you don't get needlessly stressed by emotionally locking yourself onto one path. 

Best wishes to your family.

"I have worked full time as a recreation provider on a Dementia unit for 7 years. I offer programming to 43 residents. 

The answer will vary, but three of the strongest things that might help her are music, and an old familiar activity/something meaningful to do, and tea.

Learn about what music she likes. Try to familiarize yourself with it as well. When you visit with her, play the music. Depending on the style, sing along, or even dance (a lot of my residents will go from anxious to joyously happy for the duration of a dance). If that's not her/your style, you could also try sitting beside her, and putting headphones on her ears so she can listen to it. Hold her hand and just enjoy the moment together.

Another thing I try to engage my residents in is Montessori for Dementia - style programming. Bring some laundry from home and fold it together. Was she a knitter/crocheter? Bring some supplies with you and try it. Keep in mind if she's ever an aggressive type, consider what you bring her. She may or may not be allowed to keep that stuff in her room. Knitting, for those who did it their whole life, and can still see well enough/have mobile enough hands, can work wonders. I have a resident that wanders in a panic for a good 80% of her unstructured time every day. I can get her to sit for a good 30 minutes and focus on knitting. Knitting/crocheting might be too hard, but something to think about. I have residents who are really into coloring, flipping through magazines/catalogues, some who like to tidy up. 

Another relaxer is a nice, hot cup of tea, if that was your grandma's way to mellow out. You can bring decaf in if you're worried about caffeine consumption. 

You can try different combinations. Maybe come, visit with her, have a tea/cookie. Try a different activity for a while then settle in and listen to music. If she isn't too overstimulated, the music can help as a mood setter, while you engage in other things.",,,,shannon0303,,,1466641397,t5_2rfqf,t3_4pd39j,t3_4pd39j,2,1469228536,0,0,d4k5jnh,dementia,2,,

My dad is 51 and has FTD. Seen symptoms from 3 years back but now its moving VERY FAST and to the point where he cant control his bowels and his reasoning and personallity are all gone. Got back from genetics test appointment and found out he has this PSEN2 gene and there was only 1 other case in the world right now in their database of what he has. An extremely rare case and now Me and my sister have a 50% of developing this early onset dementia. (Im 23 shes 26). She recently had a child and now if she has the gene her son will have the same 50% chance of developing this. We were told we can get tested but it may not show up until the disease spreads and we get a bit older. Im not getting tested I DO NOT want to know if this will happen to me or not. So now having kids for me is out since if I have it my child will be 50% having it too. Wish there were some scientists or something that I could help do research since its so rare.

"Well, lets just start by saying that this is a difficult situation. This yelling could very well be a part of his dementia, especially if it is happening around the same time every night (patterns develop in behavior). Its likely nothing to do with abuse. What would concern me is the fact that it goes on for hours at a time. This could possibly be evidence of neglect. 

A good course of action would be to contact your local Ombudsman's office and let them know whats going on. They can go in there and check the place out as well as dig around if they see anything suspicious. 
You can also contact the local Community Care Licensing office and make a complaint (Its the social services department for senior care facilities). The facilities' licensing number will be posted on their website  somewhere, use that to reference when making the complaint.

"I would do my best to get her off the streets if you see her as a danger to herself and other drivers. 

There is such thing as age related memory impairments. However, repetition of the same story on numerous occasions is abnormal. 

The frequency of falls place her at risk for a traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI in geriatric patients can display similar impaired memory systems like dementia, specifically Alzheimer's. You also mentioned she has diabetes. Any patient with a history of uncontrolled diabetes is at risk for a cognitive impairment as well. 

Personally, I would try to get an MRI or CT to see if there are changes in her brain. Additionally, I'd also seek a speech-language pathologist (SLP) to evaluate her cognitive functioning. There are many assessment tools SLPs utilize to compare her cognitive functioning with that of others of same age and/or gender.

"Hi! I'm sorry to hear that your mum - and you and your family - are going through this. It's one of the most heartbreaking illnesses I have ever experienced - along with everyone else that goes through it. 

Just to introduce myself - I am 22 years old and I have a Granddad who has Dementia, and has done for around 6 years. . . although he was properly diagnosed only a couple of years ago. I was one of the first people to spot that my Granddad wasn't well back when I was 16/17 through little things that he did (quite similar to your mum, actually) like getting lost driving through a town that he knows like the back of his hand, driving through red lights and forgetting who Saint George was, which, believe it or not, was a massive flashing warning sign in my head, as everyone in my town referred to him as that (my Granddad is a bit of a local celebrity). From the point that I could see he wasn't very well, he declined rather rapidly and nothing could be done to stop it. During the time of his decline, around two years after we spotted the early signs, I was at university in London whilst all of my family were the ones experiencing the effects of Alzheimer's back home. In my mind it made me sad knowing that I wasn't there whilst he was ""well"" and, to some extent it still gets to me but, what I will say (and this may sound selfish, but please don't see it this way) if I was there, back home, I would have gotten very annoyed at him for the little things he couldn't help doing - like my family often did whilst they were trying to deal with it. I'd have regretted having a short temper with him, I'd have regretted getting annoyed when he couldn't remember my name or that I was his granddaughter (which he would often ask me when I went home during term time) so, what I would say is this (and excuse the bluntness please, I just want to be as real with you as I can): 

Don't go home. If you put your life on pause to go home to help a situation that can't be stopped when you are struggling already, you will come to despise everything surrounding you. You won't remember your mum in the way you'd like to. You would witness your mum's decline everyday and, slowly but surely, your childhood memories would be replaced by you witnessing your mother digress to a childlike state.

Whilst she will be mentally ""gone"" at some point once the illness takes its toll, what I will say is this; just because she will not be able to do the things she once could, she is still there. In human, living form at least. A common situation I have found from Alzheimer's is that people see the person as dead once the Alzheimer's has taken over, and that's not the case. When my Granddad got put into a home last year, my uncle spiralled into a downward spiral of depression and didn't work for nearly a year. He witnessed my Granddad become progressively worse day in, day out as they lived together and, eventually, just didn't acknowledge that he was actually still alive when he moved to a home. From this I have learnt that any time you spend with your loved one suffering from Alzheimer's is just as credible as spending time with them when they're lucid, so you don't need to move home. What I would suggest you do is come to terms with Alzheimer's first, read up about it and become acquainted with it so that when you see your mum, you will be able to embrace it rather than get upset and struggle some more. 

Whenever I see my Granddad now, we are still making memories. Sure, it's more one-sided, but take it with a pinch of salt. I love seeing my Granddad and he comes out with some of the most hilarious things I've ever heard. He's still there as the sarcastic, cheerful ladies man I've always known him to be, but he just doesn't remember things. I do think that my response to his condition is partly credited to the fact that I wasn't at home all the time during university, where I would've become annoyed. 

If both your dad and brother are struggling to cope at home, then I would suggest that they look into a home that specialises with Alzheimer's patients or getting a visiting nurse to pop in to help around the house to ease the pressure. 

Please don't feel selfish or helpless. There are things you can do, which will make a huge difference. Just be there for her when you can, don't be short tempered around her and embrace the illness as much as possible. There is an amazing network around for those who are affected by the illness such as the Alzheimer's Association, The Alzheimer's Society and many, many more, who are all there to offer guidance and support to you when you need it. They will be able to listen to you and reassure you that everything will be ok but, in the mean time, what I would suggest - and it worked for me, but obviously may not work for you - is that you read up about Alzheimer's, what happens to those that have it and just generally become acquainted with it - because if you understand it and come to terms with it, it will most likely affect how you respond to your mum. 

Try and get involved in these societies in whichever way you can - me and my mum raised £2,500 for the Alzheimer's Society this Christmas because I want to raise awareness for it and hopefully find a cure. Maybe this will make you feel a bit less helpless. 

If you ever need to chat, please just let me know. I know how difficult it is and think that having a support network to listen and talk to is the best way to cope with these things! And sorry again for being straight to the point. ",,,,rosiep93,,,1465763262,t5_2rfqf,t3_4k6wsq,t3_4k6wsq,1,1468991261,0,0,d46emrv,dementia,1,,

"I work in long term care. When I interact with residents with dementia I always take behaviors with extra care and consideration. I try to learn what they are likely to do and plan around it. Like I always keep residents that ""goose"" me positioned so I  don't have my back turned to them. If I know they are non compliant with diet I don't leave them unattended with food on the table.

Think of it in the same mindset you would handle a child. He simply didn't know any better. If you are acting as a caregiver it's important that you always remember he doesn't know better and it's why he needs the help.

Going forward anticipate the behavior and plan around it.  

Being a caregiver isn't easy.  I can't even begin to imagine what it's like to care for your own family member. If you are feeling overwhelmed or even need a short break to handle the recent situation con the social worker and see if he's eligible for respite care.

"I have been taking care of my grandmother for 3 years and there are 3 other caregivers that come to give me relief. There are a couple of hurdles that exist when having multiple caregivers so I'll try my best to explain tyw issues that I have dealt with.

-Confusion is a part of dementia care. Doing things in blocks does help, but it also helps to have a weekend specific person. Somehow we are trained to look for something different on the weekend and whenever we had a person who was just there on weekends (sat and sun only) that seemed to help. Try to shoot for 2-3 days IN A ROW per person, if you REALLY love someone, but they can only work one day per week, make sure it is a Friday or a Monday. 

-The biggest issue with multiple caregivers is simply getting all the caregivers on the same page and KEEPING them on the same page. 

So many times I have torn my hair out because there was a med switch and one of the caregivers didn't check the text I sent them or whatnot. We have since adopted charting. We keep a spiral bound notebook and whoever is on shift that day is obligated to write pertinent information in it. Nurse/hospital visits, calls from medical providers and details,  anything new with the patient? Acting different? Experiencing ANYTHING out of the ordinary? Write it THE EFF DOWN! This will help you identify trends even though you aren't there. It will help you identify issues before they possibly turn into a needed hospital visit. It is a caregivers job to read through the log to see what has been going on for the past few days.

-Make each day the same. We do 24 hour care here for gram. Shifts begin at the same time, and end at the same time for everyone person, ever day. You are going to have people try to push back on this. For the sake of the patient, don't let them. I once had a caregiver try to tell me she couldn't stay past dark so her schedule needed to change to mirror when the sun set. Caregiver changes happen at 8am or 8pm. I politely told her to EFF off. It is set specifically at those times for a very good reason and it is because of pill schedules and such. 

-The fridge! This is a newer issue since I have cut back my hours. The fridge becomes a sea of partially consumed items...non of which you or the patient will be able to see when it was opened and whether it is still safe to consume. Make it a household rule to label anything that has been opened or made. A small plate of sausages lurking in the back of the fridge? Who made it? Doesn't matter if it has a date on it. We keep masking tape and a permanent marker on the kitchen counter. You would be shocked how much of an issue food poisoning can be with a bunch of people coming and going.

-Hire a cleaner to come at least once a month if you don't already have one. I have said it once and I will say it a million times more: Caregivers are there to care for a patient. They are not maids. This is a difficult distinction to establish in the beginning for a patient new to caregiving (especially non family) but it is crucial to establish. You don't talk to your maid about health issues, and a patient needs to see a caregiver as a caregiver, and not a maid specifically for that reason.  Light cleaning like keeping a kitchen clean and wiping up spots is expected. Never expect a caregiver to get on their knees and scrub out a toilet. A caregiver needs to be able to focus on the monitoring and care of the patient and not the patients house. There are other reasons, but these are the main ones. I have it outlined for my caregivers what is expected to be cleaned up and I draw the line at 'if you wouldn't do it at least daily, then a cleaner needs to do it'. Every caregiver needs to contribute in the same ways. 

Making everything as fair is possible makes things easier. Pay everyone the same. No pay  premiums for certain expertise. That will only cause problems for you down the road with the other caregivers. 

I'm sure there are other things. These are the things that were big things that immediately sprang to mind. Feel free to ask questions. ",,,,DoctorFlimFlam,,,1464907335,t5_2rfqf,t3_4m70wy,t3_4m70wy,2,1468771580,0,0,d3tq4bl,dementia,2,,

Make the house as safe as possible. Put the dogs outside during meal time, or in a different room. 

A lot of these issues are him trying to be helpful- fixing the sink, rearranging things, feeding the dogs. Find a way that he thinks he's being helpful, and gear it towards his interest. Maybe a fiddle board depending on how advanced he is? Can he sort a big bucket of nuts and bolts? With dementia, they can't be expected to entertain themselves. Try playing music he likes, as well.

Eventually - maybe after two months - he stopped talking about going home as frequently and over time it ceased altogether.

I don't see any way around getting up and reassuring her that she is going home ""soon"". Hopefully it's just a temporary thing and you'll go back to full nights of sleep.

"She will usually eat what she successfully sneaks back to her room unnoticed if she first succeeds in making a palatable combination of food in the first place. Her ability to consciously make edible foods has mostly disappeared and she will throw a variety of whatever is in the fridge together which I assume is the excitement of making it to the fridge and wanting a bit of everything. Due to constant efforts on the entire family to discourage her from using the stovetop, as she usually leaves the heat on, and the microwave, where she puts things in for hours instead of minutes, she has successfully stopped using them. What I take from that is that she's still capable of learning not to do something due to creating a dangerous situation whether it be burning the house down or maintaing a dangerous blood sugar level throughout the day (still working on this one). 

Her craving for coffee in ungodly which I can only presume is for the effects of the caffeine, she will similarly go to great lengths to try and make it regardless of us making her a cup for breakfast. Due to her breaking a glass pot style coffee machine in the past we upgraded to a Keurig which has the benefit of never having any leftover coffee in a pot for her to focus on. Regardless she still makes attempts at manipulating the keurig machine which involves placing a coffee cup under it and hitting the button which at most will just make hot water if the reservoir is filled. After realizing it's just water she will take the used K cups, which only have coffee grinds in them and are never disposed of by their user, cut them open and place the coffee grinds in a cup of water thinking she can get a caffeine kick from it but she never drinks the concoction as it's not pleasant to take swigs of coffee grinds. 

She definitely takes some pleasure in trying to beat the safe guards we have in place which is evident by her repeating attempts at getting through them. One of the most worrying times in her pursuit of food was when she would take one of the large kitchen chairs over to the cabinet so she could reach the goods on the uppermost shelf, due to her small height she would have to tippy toe with tongs to grab an item, I'm surprised she never fell and hurt herself as she has episodes where she goes on falling rampages though she's been good lately. 

That's interesting you mentioned the inverse of overeating as, now that I think of it, my grandma has done the same but I always assume she just made too much to handle or it was unpalatable. Many of the times she sneaks food she leaves a large amount untouched on her bedside table.  ",,,,hardful,,,1466142287,t5_2rfqf,t3_4ohd2t,t1_d4coizy,1,1469100077,0,0,d4cphmv,dementia,1,,
"In home agency staffing works out better, buy only at first because the patient needs are minimal. Care gets progressively more expensive as the needs of the patient increase. For in home care, that care may likely extend past that 4-6 hour window to eventually around the clock and that is insanely expensive. In a facility, there are levels of care. One of may grandmothers is in a facility and the other is at home. The home care we are paying $15 per hour 24/7 because she is end stage Parkinson's with Lewy Body Dementia and she needs major in home care round the clock. That is nearly 11k per month in care. Some agencies do give deals but look at the fine print for tiers of care. My other grandmother is at a private facility that keeps getting more expensive as her care needs increase. Her care currently costs 3800 per month, soon to increase to 4500 per month. She is being moved to I believe a state run facility because she can't afford that much anymore. 

Medicare does not cover long term care, in facility or home. There is supplemental insurance that would cover it but she would have had to have purchased that before she was 65 I believe. I can't remember but Medicaid might, but there may be limits on how much you can use. If she qualifies for Medicaid, then I would absolutely look into it. Some states have programs available to help offset the cost of caring for a loved one in home, and qualification is usually also dependant on income and assets. Also if her husband was ever in the military and saw combat, she may qualify for something called Aid and Attendance. It is a pain in the butt to apply for, but hey, money is money. 

Another thing to make sure of if you are seriously considering in home care is staffing agencies insure their workers. If you hire private individuals not through an agency make sure you attach a rider on your mom's homeowners policy to free her if liability in the event that a caregiver hurts themselves in her house. 

All these numbers are pretty big. Depending on where you live it may not be so bad. I'm in California and everything here is expensive. ",,,,DoctorFlimFlam,,,1464977707,t5_2rfqf,t3_4m70wy,t1_d3ui9wl,1,1468789640,0,0,d3urtjj,dementia,1,,

"This exact same thing happened with my father-in-law (I'll call him Gary)! He and the family physician were old friends. Gary even built his house.

Gary was an independent, outspoken, man; and even when he couldn't operate a light switch, he could still talk about the good old days for hours on end. So, he'd see the doctor and reminisce for a while and the doctor would think things were fine. I got very angry, because we were lost as to what do do and were begging the doctor to help get Gary to a specialist and to pull his driver's license. His response was ""It's just normal age-related memory loss"". All the while Gary was getting into dangerous situations (physically and financially) and insisting that he was perfectly fine.

Within two years, Gary was in a lock-down unit, with stage 5 fronto-temporal dementia. It's been a rough ride for everyone! Incidentally, his doctor did come to visit him in the nursing home. He lost his keys and almost didn't get out because the staff thought that he was a patient!

When I first met my FIL, some sixteen years ago, I knew something was off. As time passed, I brought it up more often with my husband. It was complete denial in the family until he got to stage 4. It's been my observation that old friends and family are often quite resistant to acknowledging dementia in a loved one because it means that they have lost that person and that they might end up the same way. Scary stuff, as you know!

I can't advise you on the Canadian health care system; but she needs a neurological exam. Document her behaviors and get a group of family members to accompany her to the doctor with their concerns. Doctors generally don't want to take away a patient's independence, because it usually means a rapid decline; but there comes a point where concerns for the safety and well-being should take precedent. 

My final advice to you is that you visit an expert elder law attorney and get all paperwork in order before the diagnosis. My husband and I were able to get Gary to sign a durable power of attorney just before it was too late. It has been instrumental in our ability to manage his care. Best wishes to you and your family. Sorry that you are going through this.

"That is the biggest drawback. Reliable caregivers are very few and far between. It took me years to find an amazing mix. Despite the fact that they are super reliable, things happen. They have family events, get sick, you know, normal human stuff. I also have a few people that are what I call swing(not regularly in the mix but occasionally available to watch grandma, but that doesn't mean that they will be available to pick up a shift in the event of an absence. If no one can work, I am indeed the one that has to pick up the slack. 

I'm not going to lie, for the past 3 years I have missed 80% of weddings/birthdays/baby showers/etc, and have worked almost 100% of holidays during that same time. That is just how it goes when you are the main coordinator and your family either lives too far away or ""has too much going on"" in their own lives to give relief. This is where going through an agency or placing the patient in a facility is hugely advantageous. The patient gets care, and your life doesn't end up treading water for years. 

Here is a really excellent story to illustrate my point: Two years ago I had scheduled 2 days off for Mother's day. I made sure there was coverage backwards and forwards because I had invited like 4 mom's over for a really special meal. The morning of mother's day the caregiver on shift doesn't show. When I call her, she quits on the spot citing grams recent behavior(dementia sucks). I have an absolute meltdown. This was THE FIRST social event I felt comfortable hosting because prior to this point, grams care was a lot less reliable. I basically spent an hour on the phone with her begging her to work just that day and I would personally pay double for the shift because none of my other people could cover. I was so angry and frustrated that I had to take time out of my mother's day that I had been planning for weeks to address a major staffing issue. I wish this was the only time this happened. It happens more often than I would like. I missed my niece's birthday party a couple weeks ago becaise of a staffing conflict. 

I am not going to lie, you will have to pick up the slack at some point and you will miss events/holidays that are important to you if you take on this responsibility. That is the nature of this lifestyle. It sucks. If you have any family or friends that have a life, you will likely resent them at some point too. You really need to examine whether you are willing to give up a ton of freedom to care for your loved one.

I ordered it 3 weeks ago and it came in 2 days ago.  No monthly fee required.  If you feel it's urgent and can afford the extra fee to have it rushed, do it.  Canada Post might be going on strike very soon.

I think we got extremely lucky with the Doctor.  For years anytime my grandmother had an appointment either my mother or I would accompany her, mostly because she doesn't drive but she always wanted us in the room anyway in case she forgot to ask important questions.  So when my mother called about the changes in her she just told the receptionist that we wanted to speak the doctor about it without her present because she wasn't going to walk in there herself and admit she had a problem and we were extremely concerned.  They fit us in the same day at the end of the day, so we were able to take our time and really discuss the issues.  She even gave us a blood test order and said to tell my grandmother that her office called requesting a blood test 'because it's that time of year again' and when they couldn't reach her on the phone they called my cell so I could pick it up.  

Normally no, they cannot discuss another patient.  But we weren't asking for her records, we were giving her a heads up that when the dr asks ""how is everything?"" Her answer of ""everything is just great"" is a big fat lie.  

I was also named Guarantor in her will several years back (before she started having these problems) and have power of attorney over her financial matters.  I already do her banking for her and when she is officially deemed unable to make decisions for herself all I have to do is go to the Notary and finalize it.  

I really hate to say it but things kind of worked out very well for us so far.  She happened to hurt her foot the day before we brought her to the ER, so when she called my mother that night during a hallucination we used her sore foot as an excuse to get her there.  She was all for it until we got there and she didn't recognize the hospital.  Her heightened confusion and paranoia really tipped off the ER staff and we didn't have to do much explaining from that point.  

What we thought was an occasional problem at night and sometimes during the day when she was tired or in an unfamiliar place, has turned out to much worse than we could have imagined at this stage.  We used to call her everyday and would take turns visiting her almost daily when possible, but now that we're with her all the time we really see how far it's progressed without us noticing before.  We wonder how long it's been this bad and we didn't realize it.  ",,,,Aparty,,,1466639803,t5_2rfqf,t3_4pb3k4,t1_d4k31pt,1,1469228038,0,0,d4k4hjx,dementia,1,,

My dad's GP is a complete ass-haddock about doing anything proactive for his dementia.  We've had to say things like, ""If we have to remove him from your care in order to make sure his needs are met, it would be unfortunate because we'd have to start over with a new doctor.

I have no idea why this is so--they guy has tons of patients, so he can't be too concerned about loss of income from my dad not seeing him for every little thing.

Does your province or municipality have any kind of care-line that they offer for issues like where to get child care, how to help the elderly, etc?  In my state, our department of health and welfare does this, and they've given me some good referrals.  Basically, it might help to be looking for an eldercare social worker to come in and do an assessment on your grandmother.  It's not scary like a, ""OMG, they're coming to take Grandma away!"" kind of thing, but an in-home visit where they talk to her and to family members, get a baseline for her current health, and then provide recommendations to you all based on their observations.

"When the primary caregiver is unwilling/unable to keep up with the demands, and/or when the person with dementia would benefit. It's hard to say, and it's different for everyone. I've been told by many people that if you're starting to wonder if it's time, it's probably time. 

Some common reasons: 

-  when Mom/Dad requires 24/7 care, but the caregiver cannot stay home with them

-  when the person with dementia becomes incontinent.

-   when the person starts wandering outside the home, and the home can't be adequately secured. 

-  when the person with dementia is bored and not stimulated, and would do better surrounded by more people 

-  when delusions and hallucinations are uncontrollable 

-  when aggression becomes a problem 

-  when the caregiver is burned out- their mental and physical health is at risk 

What does your mom think? How is she coping? How long will their financial resources support him staying at home? 

You may want to emphasize to mom that it's not ""giving up"" if he moves into a NH. She will still need to be very involved in his care- making sure he's being cared for, safe and happy. It would just be in a different role.

I know that you desperately want to, but she is likely past the point where she could be easily soothed or treated for particular issues.  Is there any kind of sedative or anxiety reducing medication in her treatment regimen?  ",,,,caseyoc,,,1467320650,t5_2rfqf,t3_4qn31b,t3_4qn31b,2,1469407349,0,0,d4ui0q0,dementia,2,,

"With many dementias, long term knowledge (or ""old"" information) is the last to go, so I'm wondering why she needs to be quizzed to prep her on answers such as her date of birth, last four digits of SSN, address, etc.  

That said, because your Mom *will fail* the competency quizzing at the most inopportune time at some point in the future, your family's better approach would be to activate the POA so that her designated representative can speak for her regarding family business.  Depending on how the POA is written, activating it may require two physicians (usually in the fields of neurology or gerontology) to declare her incompetent to handle financial business.   An elder law attorney in your state can give you guidance on this process.

"Contact the Agency on Aging in your state as well as the Public Health department in your county.  I learned that Medicare covers  public health nurses to check on my Mom 2x per week for 1 hour each time *provided* that she is homebound and that leaving the house involved a *significant and taxing effort* and/or that she has had a significant change in medication.   If my Mom needed help bathing, Medicare covers someone to come in and do that.   The plan of care has to be updated by the nurses every 30 days to determine if a need continues to exist.  None of this helps with your real need: having someone there several hours a day to monitor him due to his dementia.  That's because Medicare wants people in facilities as doing so results in fewer additional expenses that can be related to dementia like falls, medication overdose/underdose, and so on.

I have been told by researchers in the field that the first step in genetic testing (besides genetic counseling, of course) is to have the currently afflicted patient tested.  That patient is screened for the known mutations.   Those tests, if positive, will identify the specific mutations that are present.  The offspring and other relatives can then have more focused genetic testing that evaluates just those mutations that could be present.  

To your question regarding discussion points with the doctor, I'm not sure how to motivate the doctor to prescribe and (more importantly) the insurance company to pay for the testing.  I know that there are some research programs doing that, but it requires the patient to be tested first.  As I learn more, I'll post about it here.

"I'm also in Canada so hopefully this will help...(I'm also long-winded, sorry about that)

My grandmother was the same for many years but started declining quickly the past several months.  She called my mother a few times to come rescue her at night.  She lived alone and refused to move in with anyone, but she was having vivid hallucinations at night, for years she said it was 'visitors' we figured she was seeing spirits or her meds were causing weird dreams.

So the first thing we did was made an appointment with her dr, without her present.  We discussed our concerns and told her things that had been happening.  Flooding the kitchen, 'visitors' at night, needing things explained multiple times, she would say something she did the day before happened several weeks ago, she would forget big things (like choosing a house to move into with my mother and then backing out after a deposit had been made), and her baking skills REALLY took a dive (biscuits calling for 2 tbsps of shortening, she would put a pound of it). 

Her dr was very helpful.  She suggested since my grandmother was pretty good during the day but it came out at night to bring her to the ER when she was in a confused state.  So the next night when we had the opportunity present we brought her in.  Not only was she confused, she didn't know what city we were in, she was angry, aggressive and paranoid.  Having the triage nurse and dr see her like that and get it in writing for her file was #1.  Some Drs that's enough to then order a geriatric assessment.  Unfortunately we're in Quebec and that can take months.

They did do a urine test (because UTI's can present with confusion), full blood work up to make sure it wasn't her meds.  The ER dr told her ""no more living alone, this is for your safety"" and then her GP ordered a CT scan.  We're waiting on results from that.  

I highly recommend getting her a medical id bracelet.  I ordered one for my grandmother, we didn't want to use the D word or the A word, not only because we don't have an official diagnosis but using them around will freak her out.  I just put ""her name...if lost call...(mine and my mother's phone numbers).  It has beading and looks pretty so she's thrilled with it and understands that she gets confused and this is something we hope to never need, but want as a security measure.  We no longer let her out of our sight (she needs directions to the bathroom several times a day) but just in case she wanders off its good to have.  

Good luck.  ",,,,Aparty,,,1466617592,t5_2rfqf,t3_4pb3k4,t3_4pb3k4,2,1469219867,0,0,d4jnfyo,dementia,2,,

"Leaving things around that are cues for them to do things.  For example, one man with advanced AD would shower himself, clip his nails, shave, do his hair, etc.  But only very rarely.  We figured out we could prompt his grooming routine by leaving a towel, and a fresh pair of clothes on the foot of his bed, and a light on in the bathroom.  If he woke up, and all of those things were in place, there was a much better chance that he would be prompted to follow whatever is left of his grooming routine memory and do it all himself.  Which is obviously much preferable for everyone than having a caregiver do it all for them.
