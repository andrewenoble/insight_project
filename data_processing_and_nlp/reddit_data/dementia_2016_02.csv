"My mother was diagnosed in 2009 with early onset Alzheimer's (59 y.o.) and she passed away a week ago. So that would be roughly 7 years. ",,,,reyreydingdong,,,1456786170,t5_2rfqf,t3_43vb38,t3_43vb38,1,1458824013,0,0,d0in1m4,dementia,1,,
"They make a lot of latches that lock automatically like this but have slightly different designs. Some are more complicated than others. Maybe a trip to the hardware store would give you ideas on what may work to keep her out of the fridge. 

As far as cabinets, they make a TON of locks specifically for cabinets. For those, a magnetic child lock is likely the best way to keep her out. There is no hardware for her to fiddle with as it is all located inside the cabinet. FYI, if you go this route, keep the magnet attached to a string, attached to the cabinet so it doesn't get misplaced (speaking from experience). If she tinkers, she likely will not be able to figure out a magnetic lock because her problem solving is tactile trial and error. My gram is the same way. She'd fiddle with it until it worked and the mag lock was one she never got the hang of. I would recommend a magnetic lock on the fridge, but I can't think how to make it work without breaching the door seal on your fridge.

With POA you will be able to stop all the mail and magazines that are preying on your grandmother (unless she will cooperate and help you put a stop to all this fake nonsense, which I doubt she will do). Hopefully she has not sign any contracts or promissory notes. That's another reason you need to get POA.

Can't your grandmothers sister go with her to see the doctor? If not, I'm sure your grandmother has other friends that would be willing to take her.

Your suggestion of replacing all the fake health books with real health books and articles (that do not ask for money) is a very good suggestion. I would do that. That way she will not feel like something is being taken away from her.

"Okay, a lot's happened since I last wrote you. He's exhibiting behavioral traits of emerald, amber, and now, ruby -- although for the most part, I'd say he's roughly in the amber zone. He spent all day yesterday in the garage, waiting around, eager to *get home*. He was okay around dinnertime, then a little later he got some wire cutters and attempted fashioning a metal clothes hanger into a lock pick to enter my grandma's keyhole-less 2015 Nissan Altima. We stopped him. He was a little pissy for a bit and went in to chill around. Tried sleeping at night, but that didn't work. Fairly normal routine for his ""bad days.""

*Then*, after 2am, he came came into my room four times before escaping. I was awake for this because I'm a night owl. The first time, he came in to tell me that he has to ""get all the stuff together"", I told him how late it was and not to worry about it because it's 2am, to go to sleep, and that we'd get it together in the morning. He just repeated himself twice and walked off. The second time he came in, he asked ""is there a lake in here?"", so I told him there wasn't and again, reminded him of the time, etc. Third time he came in struggling to ask if I could open the front door, and I told him that we never use that door, we always come in through the garage. Which is true. And, finally, the fourth time he came in to ask ""where's the [key motions] for the ___""? So I filled in the blanks for him and asked why. Didn't have a reason, obviously, and he didn't even say he wanted/needed to go home this time. I told him that we'll get in the car and go in the morning. He seemed okay with that for a second, before walking off. He seemed tired and delirious so I figured that was the last of him for the night. Thinking he'd gone to sleep, a few minutes later, I hear my grandma's voice and some other commotion, and the garage door opening. So I go to the garage to find my grandpa walking down out the drive way and down the street, in the cold, wearing his pajamas. We both hollered at him, telling him we're leaving in the morning, but he wasn't having any of that. He just looked back and stared blankly before continuing in the direction he left in. I took a moment to grab a jacket and my keys to go scoop him up. I found him several houses down the road and offered him a ride, to which he obliged and he seemed half pleased yet half indifferent. I let him direct me which way I needed to go for a little bit, so I could drive him around without so he doesn't think we're going back from whence he came. In the car, he told me that he hopes my wife won't get mad at me, I told him ""oh no, it's cool, she doesn't care"". I don't have a wife or girlfriend. His mind is elsewhere; week by week, I feel like his mental state is deteriorating.

And no, he's never carried his cell phone in his life. He always left it at home was generally ignorant of technology. My mom and I tried really hard over the past decade to get him on the internet so he could exercise his mind a little but he simply didn't care. If anything I'll have to insert a tracking device within or onto his shoe, whichever's less noticeable. I've been trying the fake phone calls so I can tell him that one of his close friends from the gun club will be on the way to pick him up in an hour, but he just doesn't give a shit or the idea of him getting picked up doesn't register with him. He was always fiercely independent, he drove everywhere all the time.

For now, try redirecting. If she's getting into mischief. Try playing music, putting a show on, coloring books, etc. If she steals something just retrieve it later. Hoarding is very common. Just let her take it then do a sweep over her room later on. Also if she asks about dead relatives don't remind her of their death. They relive the shock and pain all over again. Instead tell her they're at work, or the store and they'll be back later. It gets tiresome very quick. Just try to realize what she's going through.

"I find it shocking and disgraceful that MDs can be so out of touch in dealing with death and dying. I worked as a nurse's aide for some years and am currently a nursing student. As an aide in an LTC, I saw death frequently, routinely comforted the dying, cleaned and cared for them in every way, and then made their body ready and dressed for removal. The concept of palliative care and having a good death was always on our mind. Us stupid CNAs. Those silly nurses that physicians love to shout at and belittle. Doctors make extremely out of touch decisions and give very biased information based on their lack of knowledge of death, but also based on real profit motives. It is more profitable to an oncologist to aggressively treat a patient's cancer rather than refer them hospice care! They push excruciating treatments for people with near zero chances of it helping. They do surgeries such as total hip replacements on people with profound dementia. Who benefits from such extreme treatments and surgeries? Surgeons, oncologists and pharmaceutical companies.  It is not only an educational deficit. It has has reached the point of being unethical. It's lovely that this young physician had the epiphany that a good death is desirable and that sometimes it's time to stop pulling out all the stops...but really, is this not common sense? Does this MD need a special pat on the back for confronting death the way all her underlings do on a routine basis?

When you are completely emotionally drained by a mother who has always been emotionally immature and just keeps wanting to suck you dry. When a parent attempts to make you the choosen one because it is easier and more convenient for them. When no matter what you do, your parent will never be happy and has no consideration for your feelings and only concern for themselves. When no matter how many boundaries you put up or distance yourself, your parent keeps attempting to dig their talons into your throat in their endless neediness.

Also, I have a good friend that is in a very similar situation to yours. For months she and her sister would get several phone calls a days from there mother quilting them because they had to do the best thing for her by placing her in a care facility. After several agonizing months and lots of support from friends, they  realized they needed to put up healthy boundaries with their mother. So they decided to each take one phone call a day from their mother and let all her other calls go to voicemail. They also let the care home know this in case their was an emergency, then the care home could contact them. Well, it worked like a charm. The next day they both took their one call from their mother, and all her other calls went to voicemail. Then when they spoke to her the following day, she did not even remember what had happened with the phone calls the day before. In her mind, she had talked to them several times like always. - Everyone with dementia is different, but maybe this would be worth a try for you.

person also gets really agitated and aggressive, so I understand how frustrating it can be. I've found that sometimes, if she insists on going somewhere or going to see someone, and I can't redirect- then getting in the car and just driving for 20 minutes is enough to calm and distract her. The stimulation of the scenery, motion of the car, and feeling of being ""out"" (freedom). She always really enjoyed driving, so being in the car is comforting for her. On that one particular day I described, after a few minutes of walking, she had already forgotten where she was going. I pulled up, cheerfully offered a ride, drove around the block a few times, and kept up general chit chat. We got to the house, and she went right in and settled down to some tea and cookies. She felt like she ""accomplished her mission.""  Lately, she's having difficulty recognizing her home- she will look around and say ""this is my stuff, but it's not my house! I want to go home! My parents are expecting me."" Or, we will pull up the house after being out, and she will say ""this isn't my house, I'm not going in!"" Depending on how cooperative she is, we will either go inside (I'll say ""okay, let's go in and I'll call for directions to go home"" or we'll drive around the block for a few times and then try again). I've also made fake phone calls- ""well, I can't drive, but I'll call a taxi and see if they can come."" Make a fake call, apologize and say there's no taxis available. 

Another strategy is to apologize. There's very little that someone can do or say when you just constantly apologize and agree with them- there's nothing to feed off of. ""I'm sorry, I wish I could help."" ""I'm sorry, there's no way to get there."" ""I'm sorry, I understand."" 

http://www.whcawical.org/files/2013/08/Five-Ways-to-Say-Im-Sorry-With.pdf

A lot of people think that ""home"" is more of a feeling than a place. When they ask to go home, they're expressing that they feel insecure, uncertain, or are remembering a familiar and comforting time/place. It can be really helpful to ask about ""home,"" and it might give you an idea of what's going on in his head. Ask about his childhood, what it was like growing up, did he like his school, who were his friends, did he have any pets... Sometimes talking about those familiar, happy times can be soothing. My person loves going through photo albums that I put together- she likes the ones of her childhood, particularly. People think that sundowning in particular may be linked to the past- a lifetime of rushing to get off work at 5, rushing to get home and make dinner, helping with the kids and homework... The typical time for sundowning occurs during a time of the day that is typically busy and hectic for most. That may be something of an instinct, after many years of that. 

Many people respond really well to a mild sedative given an hour or so before the sundowning and agitation usually starts. 

And if at the end of the day, you've tried everything- it's okay to just provide a safe space for him to pace, work out his anxiety, etc. If he can't be calmed, let him pack his things and move them to the garage. He will tire out eventually. You can always try again in half an hour, or an hour- it can change on the flip of a coin. Turn lights on so he doesn't fall, keep an ear/eye out for him, and give him a little room. Sometimes you just have to walk away- make sure they're safe, intervene if absolutely necessary, but let them be and back off. He might turn the room upside down and create a huge mess, but so what? It can be cleaned, and it's not worth escalating the situation, or anyone getting upset or hurt.

As far as making the house a little more dementia friendly, it's a lot like child proofing. Clear pathways and hallways, with few obstacles in the way of walking. Scissors and household cleaners should be in a locked cabinet. Knobs to turn on the stove burners should be hidden and only used while someone is cooking. Get alarms for the doors- I buy ones at Walmart, they are stick on and have a battery. Put them up high (or down low, people with dementia are less likely to look to the bottom of the door for a lock), and set them to either off, chime or alarm. That will let you know if he's coming in and out of the house/garage. And finally, a keyed deadbolt so that you can lock him in and allow him to wander freely in the house.

Some people are using Tile as a tracker, but I don't think it's nearly reliable enough. PocketFinder is awesome and reliable, but it's a little bulky, so you will need a way to ensure he carries it. There are GPS shoes- one you can remove part of the tread/hill and charge it, and the other is in the soles. They're pricey but might be worth the investment. Again, you'd have to be sure he wears it. There are GPS devices that can also look like a watch. And last resort, the sheriffs department of your county can provide you with either a wrist or ankle band through a project called Project LifeSaver. Does he carry a cell phone? There's a ton of GPS apps. You might have luck searching for ""lost child"" or ""lost senior"" when searching, as a lot of parents use similar devices for children with autism who are prone to wandering.

"There's no need to be passive aggressive. This is a technique that actually works pretty well for dementia patients that don't respond well to attempts to divert from ""I want to go, let me go, I'm going home, etc."" This is why many nursing homes will have fake bus stops or taxi stands on their property, so that when no distraction/diversion is working, you can maintain the peace and not escalate the situation. I got my person bundled up in appropriate clothing &amp; winter gear, the car was within 5 feet of her at all times, and she has a GPS device. By letting her walk out, she was able to soothe that urge of ""I need to go, I need to go.""

That's a great handout 

Some other techniques for dealing with the sun downing are to close all the curtains/blinds and use bright lights inside (the shadows and change from light to dark can be disorienting), play music he likes, and engage him (rather than entertaining himself with TV or whatever he usually does) to keep him focused. Perhaps you could give him tasks to help him feel useful and stay busy- he could polish unloaded guns, or take the newspapers out to the garage, whatever. A low dose of melatonin can also help some people.

"I had carefully chosen furniture and we had a wonderful day and we moved into the room after I totally furnished it and made it as homework as humanly possible. I said good night around 7 o'clock that evening, with plans to meet the next day. Less than two hours later she was literally calling everyone on her cell phone that she could – she was never very good at using the cell phone – and telling them that she had been kidnapped and she was going to strip her clothes off and walk naked into traffic and that kill herself. She called people she barely knew almost every 10 minutes, when she wasn't phoning me to threaten her life or accuse me of abducting her. The staff put her on lockdown, as assisted-living did not have secure entryways and, conceivably she could have ""escaped.  "" 

It was a terrible, traumatizing night for everybody. And it tacked  an extra thousand dollars a day to her stay in assisted-living, because she had to have 24 hour security literally sitting in the room with her until we found her a place in memory care.

"Hey SeuNomeAqui, my mom had this terrible disease as well. She passed away last september, and for me it was the most terrible time of my life. 

It started I think in the end of June 2015. At that time she showed some first signs, that something wasn't quite ok, but in the beginning, neither me nor my father realized that something was wrong. I think the first sign was her not beeing able to use computer, especially excel anymore, even though she had taken many classes and was quite good and fast at it. She also told me or my father things she had read or seen on tv multiple times, not knowing she had already told us. I thought that she might just be stressed out or had migraine, but I asked her if everything's okay and she told that she feels like something's happening inside her. We went to a neurologist and did an MRT of her brain, the doctor said there would be some kind of anomalie and sent her to a head hospital. There did all kinds of test for about a week there, but find anything out, so they sent us home and told us to come back in the end of september or earlier if something else happened.

And well, from there on it was like a bad dream, a rollercoasterride that always goes downhill. She started getting more problems in her daily life, like warming up food in the microwave, then choosing what to wear (she always put out 3 or 4 undies, but she didn't know what to do with them), she basically needed help doing anything by the end of july. 
At that time we went to the hospital again, they did some more tests and after a couple of days they told us that she had sporadic CJD. 

I think it was in the beginning of august when she got problems at speaking.
She didn't find the right words at the beginning, but it quickly evolved into her not being able to speak at all anymore after 2-3 weeks. She also showed first signs of physical decrease like muscle tensions, her not being able to ""relax"" and constantly moving her arms or legs. The doctors gave us some medicine against the muscle tensions, but that only helped for about 2 weeks, because by the end of august she wasn't able to swallow food (and therefore pills) anymore. We also couldn't brush her teeth anymore, because she didn't know how to spit out the toothpaste anymore. When the swallowing problem started, it took us sometimes an hour to get her to spit out the toothpaste, she sometimes tried to swallow it and then choked on it, because her throat muscles didn't function properly anymore. So during her last 3-4 weeks, she didn't eat anymore. 
Since it was hard for her to sleep, she had also taken some strong sleeping pills. Since she couldn't swallow those anymore, she got a small subcutaneous needle on her shoulder, so my sister and I could give her sleeping medicine ourselves. 

I should probably mention that we were lucky to have a palliative team in our town, so everyday a doctor visited us, checking in on us and talking to us, offering advice (at least she tried, she had never seen this kind of disease before). 

During her last 2-3 weeks she was in only laying in a bed, not being able to walk properly anymore. She then got a medicine pump which constantly gave her a light sedative just to keep her relaxed, a week before she died we started giving her morphine with that pump, since she was only suffering, her muscles contracting and her not being able to drink or eat anymore. She died on september 19 at night, my sister, my dad and myself were with her.

So that's just a summary of how it went, it probably sounds really sad and downing, and eventhough I experienced the most frightening moment of my life during this time (I'll explain further down), we also had some great moments.
We discovered that she reacted very positive to her old record collection. When she was still able to walk, we heard a lot of music with her, danced together which made her smile and laugh most of the times, with some her old friends she sang and danced in a group when they were visiting. The music really helped all of us, it was the only kind of hope we had. The dancing was not only fun for us, it also helped her relieve some of the muscle tensions. 

The most awful moment though was one time at night, I think it was the middle of august. I suddenly woke, hearing my mom screaming. Screaming at the top of her lungs, constantly, just stopping to breath. It was the most frightening thing I ever experienced, it seemed like she saw the devil or something at night. Luckily my sister was able to give her a sedative through the subcutaneous needle on her shoulder so she went to sleep within a few minutes. 
A few more things I want to add: 
My mom had written her patient disposal a couple of years ago. It said, that she doesn't want to be force fed or be fed through a tube. She said that if she is in pain, discomfort through physical or psychological reasons or mainly has a disease which isn't curable in any way, she want's to get sedatives so she doesn't have to suffer. 

Also to SeuNomeAqui: CJD sucks. It's a fucking shit disease. I feel for you and hope you can enjoy at least some of the time you have left with your mom. If you have any questions or need advice, anything, just write me a message, I'll send you my email. I remember that that was one of the things that struck me the most, that we had almost no one who could tell us more about the disease than the few things you find on the internet, and I really just wanted some advice on how to handle the difficulties that came with the disease from time to time. 

Last but not least, there's actually a german book written by the wife of a man who was diagnosed with CJD, it's called ""Zum Weinen ist die Zeit zu schade"", I didn't read the book properly, but the title alone helped me a lot through the time and kept me thinking positive. It means ""For crying, the time is too precious"".

"You do not need to be in this situation. You are 21 and going to college. This is not healthy for you right now. I realize by helping your mom take care of your grandmother, you are paying your rent (so to speak). However, it sounds like this situation is one you are not prepared to take on. But that's OK. A whole lot of people aren't. It's not like you can take care of her a few hours a day for a few days a week and then go home and get totally away from the situation. You live there. Anytime you are at home, you are still around the situation, and if your mother needs help when she is taking care of your grandmother, you have to help her. Right...... So basically the entire time you are at home your are on duty. Right..... School should be your main priority right now. 

There actually are some very excellent State Funded Nursing Homes in also every area of the US. My aunt was in a very nice State Funded Nursing Home. A State Funded Nursing Home charges a patient according to their income. If you Grandmother only has Social Security as her income, then a State Funded Nursing Home can only charge her what she receives from S.S. Try to get your mom to look into this for everyone's sake. If your mom hesitates or has reservations, you could research state funded nursing homes in your surrounding area. I'm sure you will find two or three very nice facilities. Something's to keep in mind. In order for SS to cover all nursing home expenses, it has to be a state funded nursing home, not a private nursing home, and your grandmother's doctor will have to write an order or a recommendation to SS that your grandmother needs nursing home care. I'm sure he knows all this stuff.

"It sounds like your grandma's dementia is slowly progressing. In a demented person the part of the brain that causes us to be impulsive, which leads to bad decisions and behaviors, becomes overly active as compared to a normal brain. At the same time, the part of the brain, in a demented person, that controls logical thinking and controls impulsive behaviors becomes very underactive, as compared to a normal brain. This is what is happening to your grandma. She has lost her ability to control her impulses. 

All the abnormal things that are happening in the brain of someone with Dementia usually manifest differently for each individual person. In your grandma's case, she has diabetes. And because she cannot control her impulses along with the fact that she is forgetful, this is why is behaving the way she is about food and eating.  

Of course because of her diabetes, you should try everything you can to keep her from sneaking food. But unfortunately, no matter what you do, this behavior will probably continue for a while, and  may even get worse. Talk to her doctor. Maybe he/she can prescribe something that will help control this behavior some.

"Thanks, but I think my grandma exacerbates the situation. First it began with her denial by writing off his symptoms as simple clumsiness. Now, he's kind of over the woman and thinks she's being controlling, fueling his desire to return back to a place/time whereby he had more control in his life, at the house he had in his 20/30s. Remarkably, in his bout with dementia, he's managed to learn one thing: that his wife isn't going to be the one to ""drive him home"", ever. Anytime I give him an excuse he gets impatient and comes into my room every 15 minutes asking me when/how he's leaving, or he goes and starts putting shit out in the garage or driveway. I've been doing some research on how to deal with him and coaching my my grandma on what to do and what not to do, but it's getting bad. I think he hurt her wrist today but I'm not entirely sure how that went down. Either her tolerance for his antics is waning or his dementia is worsening. She's considered putting him in an assisted living home but we kind of fear that might be a terrible idea for his mental and emotional wellbeing. Being in a hospital and treated for walking pneumonia a year ago was enough of an austere environment for him. This whole situation sucks.

The timing of this is all incredibly inconvenient, because I had intentions to move out of state, but I sort of feel obliged to stick around until he goes. I grew up with a single mom who traveled a lot for work and busted her ass to give me a great life, so I spent a lot of time with my grandparents. He did a lot to raise me, teaching me about guns and how to shoot. I'm actually incredibly tired of shooting lately since I've been taking him in my free time to spend time with him at our old past time and keep him occupied during the day.

"A lot of people from that generation (having lived through the Great Depression) get very focused on their money/possessions and the fear that someone is scamming them. That said, her behavior is in no way healthy/normal. In old age, it becomes more difficult to tease apart a life time of personality disorder or untreated psychiatric condition. But I tend to disagree with the conclusion that she doesn't have some kind of dementia. The early stages of Alz don't show up in imaging. There is often no physical evidence of the the mini strokes that lead to vascular dementia. I think vascular dementia may be worth investigating too, not that it matters too much because none of it is particularly treatable. Whatever the case may be, her behavior probably won't get any better and will likely become difficult at some point, and medication may help manage it. Don't hesitate to get her involuntarily committed for a psyche evaluation when her self-care deteriorates to that point.

"Whenever there is a sudden change in behavior, get him to the doctor. UTIs are more common in women, but men do still get them- and a UTI can be really serious. UTIs or another infection or physical issue can really, really change their behavior. Electrolyte imbalance, constipation, ear infection, UTI- many people with dementia lose the ability to vocalize what doesn't feel right, so the infection etc isn't always caught right away. At your earliest opportunity, either take him into the doc or do a DIY UTI test (get a basin that you can wedge under the toilet seat, so that it's resting in the bowl), UTI dip sticks from any pharmacy. Wait for him to pee and test it). If he's hesitant to go to the doc or gets nervous, don't tell where you're going- or tell a fib. 

Some people do go through the stages really quickly, but that's somewhat unusual- most take much longer.  There will be days where you think ""oh god, this is the next stage"" and then a day later, everything is normal. It's the same thing with figuring out what stage they're in- many people will have traits from several different stages.. And it changes on a dime. The progression isn't linear, it's more like a looping roller coaster that sometimes goes forward and sometimes backwards. 

Would it help you and grandma to hire an aide to watch him at night? 

It sounds like you're doing everything you can with diversion/distraction, keep it up. What you did with following him &amp; driving around- that's great! Good approach, and by letting him ""tell you"" the directions, he felt in control. Dealing with dementia is a lot harder for some people. People who were always very independent or stubborn, like your dad or my person-- well, they're not going to accept help and guidance. 

Has he seen a doctor recently? He should get a checkup and possibly medication to help settle him at night. I know people for whom medication has been the difference between staying home and going to a nursing facility. We're approaching that point with my person, actually. Not all medication will turn people into zombies-- anti depressants and atypical antipsychotics (these are safer than the older typical antipsychotics) can really help a lot. Something as mild as Ativan can help soothe and relax. 

Keep dementia-proofing the house. Keyed deadbolts to get out, maybe a lock on the garage door.  It sucks, because you feel like you're locking them in and it's like a prison... But if the alternative is escaping in the middle of the night (Caregivers might sleep through the alarm, or forget to lock the doors- it happens) and dying of exposure--- better to live in that lockdown state. If he ever wanders and you can't convince him to get in your car- sometimes a family friend or neighbor might have better luck, or the police can send out a unit out (not to scare him into complying, but to ""offer their assistance""). For what it's worth--- incontinence, wandering and aggression are the top reasons for someone to be placed in a long term care facility. If you guys decide to go that route, it isn't something to be ashamed of. If you've tried your best, that's all you can do.

"Like your idea but not sure how I as a caregiver can contribute :) 

I care for my mother who has advanced Alzheimer's Disease. In relation to pharmacy, maybe I can say that the good relationship I have with her pharmacist have over time become more and more crucial to me as her caregiver.

The complex of anti-depressant, anti-psychotic, anti-anxiety medicines for AD, on top of meds for things like BP, thyroid, reflux etc, and the rate at which the AD meds need to be changed as my mother declines, is something that the caregiver has to get on top of, but the interactions and effects, and side-effects of the various meds, are completely beyond my layman's comprehension. 

When things go wrong behaviourally or physically with my mom, I really needed a go-to person who I can tell what is happening to my mom by simply picking up the phone and calling them, or popping in to see them. 

Given that Doctors are not available by just walking into their rooms, for me that go-to person is my mom's pharmacist. So if my mom starts shuffling, or bruising tremendously easily, or is persistently loosing weight, or is not sleeping, or whatever, it is her pharmacist that I call or drop in on, and his advice is always amazing, and he is compassionate, interested and goes out of his way to help.

The availability of the pharmacist in caring for my mom is one of the rare magical elements in the disaster story of this awful, awful disease Alzheimer's. ",,,,seedpod02,,,1455138765,t5_2rfqf,t3_453039,t3_453039,2,1458417408,0,0,czv7xwe,dementia,2,,

"One of the very strange things about dementia is going through the grieving process of the loss of the person with the disease before they've actually died. In the early years of my moms disease I found myself so angry at her. She did so many shitty things to me growing up that she hadn't yet answered for. I remember hating her so much for some how ""getting out of"" answering for her mothering crimes. I helped care for my mom through her entire disease but it was never for her - it was always for my dad. As the disease progressed and her cognition disintegrated I went through many more stages of hating her, feeling sorry for her, forgiving her, hating her again, yelling at her when I knew she had no idea what I was talking about (those moments felt really good, I'm not gonna lie).
I don't have any wise words for you but I just want you to know that you're not alone in these feelings but you're not going to get what you want from her. I was 26 when my mom was diagnosed and 30 when she died so I can specifically relate to the time of life you're in. Therapy is essential to cope. 

I don't know if this will happen to you but my mom reached a point in her disease that was so terrible that there was nothing she could've done to me that would've deserved the karmic punishment of dementia. I stopped hating her and just pittied her. I cried a lot before she died but by the time she died she had been gone for so long that it was more of the echo of a death.

"Usually by the time loved ones are questioning if it's time, it really is time.

I work in a long term facility and we get a lot of patients with dementia. I can't imagine how hard it is to make that decision but I try to comfort families by telling them that eventually they get to a certain point where the caregiver burden becomes too great for the average family. It's no fault of the loved ones, it's just the progression of the disease. If I were to have dementia later on, I would rather be placed in a facility with professionals trained to deal with it than to be an increasing burden on my loved ones. Do your best to make sure it's a good facility.

By the time we get patients we feel lucky to hear families say that they are just becoming too difficult to take care of, rather than the family waiting for a significant event as a wake-up call (ex: one patient was found alongside the highway, trying to eat rocks.

"&gt;There will be days where you think ""oh god, this is the next stage"" and then a day later, everything is normal. 

This... exactly. I guess I should expect him to have off-days. Today, the lights were on and he was home, maybe because he managed to get a good full night's sleep last night. It was a beautiful day and I found him outside just chillin' with the dog in the backyard. He seemed super alert and talkative while we played with the dog and watched him chase squirrels, I was really glad for this so I asked him if he wanted to go shoot. He didn't really care to go, so I suggested we take the dog for a walk at this really nice park nearby and he seemed a little more keen on that idea. So we walked on some nature trails and talked, and he seemed great. His memory was a bit fuzzy for some things, but remarkably, he spoke in complete sentences and made perfect sense 95% of the time. It was like he went back to where his mental state was two years ago. It was so nice to have him back (to some extent) today and be with him and the dog out in the sun. A stark contrast to how he's been the past two days. As for tonight, he's still speaking clearly, though he thinks he has to put shit in my car.

And yeah, I don't think an aide to watching him at night would work. That'd be weird for everyone, especially him. As far as his medication goes, I'm not sure what he's on -- I'll have to see about that tomorrow. I think he's been to both his doctor and neurologist each at least once in the past month. Besides a little acid reflux, the man has no prominent health issues whatsoever... physically, he's still quite strong. His mind will wither away long before his body goes, sadly.

"You nailed it when you said everyone's journey through dementia is different. There's just no way to know.

But, if you want to play the law of averages: my family physician told me that the average time to death is about 10 years. The older the patient is, the lower that average becomes. Some dementia patients pull through 25 years before they die. Some die within a year. There are so many factors, all of which have significant impact.

You said your dad was diagnosed with mild dementia a few months back. Mid-stage dementia -- which may be what he is already slipping into -- is typically the longest stage, and it's the longest by far. If your dad is typical, he has years before he'll move into late-stage. Late stage is, from my understanding, mercifully short, but perhaps not short enough. It's an awful time for all concerned.

I have a parent who is in mid-stage right now, and she's been there for about 3 years. She was diagnosed as being about halfway along the dementia curve 3 years ago, so while she's doing pretty well right now, I understand that she could degrade rapidly with little warning. Not really sure how to handle that when it comes. Then again I don't think anyone really does.

Best of luck OP.

"Thanks for your reply. Yes, there are few life crimes that could possibly deserve the sentence of dementia. That is so true. I am also assisting with my mother's care for my father's sake. Not hands on, but I am the one essentially that has allowed them to stay at home and not have to move or go into an ALF because it is me who found and retained a live-in caregiver for them. I would actually help with care hands-on but I live many states away, and at this point it would be like turning in my good marriage for a bad relationship with my dementing mother. You lost your mother early, I am so sorry, though I can understand it is the long history of fucked-upedness that was probably harder than the early passing. It is all hard though, I am sorry. I have tried counseling, and I just can't anymore. It somehow feels like going over the same crap that has haunted my mind for 20+ years. No therapist can hand me my emotional redemption on a silver platter. There is some kind of work I need to do on my own. I just haven't figured out exactly how/what I need to do. It has been suggested to me, and I have tried, that I need to empathize with where she was coming from in life (ie her own abusive childhood etc). I've tried, I really have. And from a human perspective, I do feel sorry about the experiences that informed her life choices. However, I still look at what she did to me and others and say ""No way, would I hurt someone they way she chose to, no matter what."" And the the horrible, burning anger starts all over again.

"Like the others have said, you should find long-term, full-time care for her. It will not get easier. 

All the issues you list are classic Alzheimer's/dementia symptoms. It is often said that Alzheimer's is harder on the caregiver(s) than the patients since those afflicted by the disease aren't all that aware of how bad it is. Seeing my dad suffer from Alz, however, I'm not so sure if that is true. I know you are young (I was 24 when my dad was diagnosed, 27 now), but you have to understand that this is the reality of the disease and it is something your grandmother *suffers* from. It will not get better. We all have stress, none of us are equipt to ""deal with"" this disease. Even professional caregivers struggle with caring for dementia/Alz patients. 

Find professional help. It does not seem like you watching her for 4-5 hours/day is a viable option. You need to ask your mom and her doctor what the options are to get her into full-time care. 

Also, there are a lot of resources out there that offer protocol for things like asking about dead relatives, basically you should not tell her they are dead but just say they are out at the store, at work, will be home later, etc. I would highly suggest doing some research: http://www.alzheimers.gov/coping.html.

"It sounds like your grandma has had a hard time since your grandpa passed. It also sounds like you grandma probably had a difficult childhood. Has your Grandma ever talked about her childhood?

Anyway, since her doctor seems to think she does not have dementia, she may be suffering with a mental illness or personality disorder. A lot of people, especially older people, suffering from a life long mental illness or a personality disorder are extremely afraid of Psychiatric evaluations. They will **never ever** agree to this type of evaluation, so for her piece of mind, I would not try to encourage her to do an evaluation. It sounds as if she just needs your support to feel safe.

"I am an experienced caregiver. Also, my mom has Alzheimer's.

Another choice is: 

* She and her boys can hire caregivers to come stay with her in her home. They can start out with a part-time caregiver and increase hours and number of caregivers as needed. That way she can stay in her home for as long as possible.

It sounds like your mom's friend has Alzheimer's. Asking the same questions over and over again is a hallmark symptom of ALZ.

Attaching any and all names and contact info, address info, her name, address, and saying she has dementia to her tricycle is a very good Idea, if that is all that is needed for now. If she continues without some help, more than likely, she will get lost while riding her tricycle. I just hope that someone will be able to recognize when/if she needs help. People in the earlier stages of ALZ are extremely good at hiding there decline from others as well as themselves.

Also, a lot of family's will stay in denial about a loved one's decline especially when dealing with a slow progressive dementia. This is a very common reason why a lot of people with dementia do not get the daily care they need, when they actually start needing it. I see this all the time. (I should have typed DENIAL with all caps).

Another reason some people with dementia do not get the care they need is because their family and friends cannot convince them they need help. They feel if they agree to get help, their independence will be taken away. It is very difficult for a lot of elderly people to give up their independence. I can personally understand this. However, in the case of ALZ it can be very dangerous.

I do have another suggestion about what you can do to help your mother's friend. *Anonymously contact Adult Protective Services.* I know this sounds harsh and extreme, but please here me out. When notified of a situation such as this, APS will go by your mom's friends home (usually unannounced) talk with her, and observe her and her living situation. They will then contact her closest of kin and give them recommendations on what they will **have to do** in order to keep her safe. Her sons will have to comply with one or some of the recommendations, which I'm sure they would. No one will be arrested or fined money or will have a criminal record. However, once APS are notified they will check up on the situation from time to time to make sure your mom's friend is properly cared for. At some point, in the future, when they are satisfied that your mom's friend is and will be properly cared for during her entire illness, APS will close their case. I have seen this happen. Unfortunately, sometimes it takes a drastic step like this to lift the veil of denial. 

Hope these suggestions help. Good luck

&gt;A rare disease known as Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), which afflicts one in 150,000 children and teenagers, is largely unheard of but leaves patients and families in a state of desperation. If diagnosed, a child will experience quick and progressive mental and physical deterioration over the course of several years — similar to Alzheimer’s disease, hence its nickname of “childhood Alzheimer’s.” Like Alzheimer’s, Niemann-Pick disease type C has no cure and typically leads to death.

My grandmother goes to an adult day program during the day but that's only for a few hours. By the time she gets home I also get home from school and am totally exhausted and just don't have the energy to deal with her sometimes.,,,,BunniiButt,,,1454957309,t5_2rfqf,t3_44rrih,t1_czsdskj,1,1458370129,0,0,czshjbq,dementia,1,,
"This is probably something for your mom, but if she hasn't already, she might want to talk to your grandma's doctor about options for managing paranoia, aggression, etc., with psychiatric medication.

Anti-depressants and/or anti-psychotics can make a world of difference.

Case in point, my mom had Alzheimers. In the beginning stages, it wasn't altogether clear what was going on, and her doctor suggested that depression in older people can cause memory problems that look like dementia. So my mom got put on an antidepressant. 

Time passed, and it became clear she wasn't depressed, that she had Alzheimer's. My sister was taking care of her, and eventually the two of us decided well let's stop the antidepressant, since why should she be taking extra medications if they're not helping. 

However, within a few weeks my mom's temperament got much worse, and it became much more difficult for my sister, because mom was always angry about everything. So we ended up restarting the antidepressant, and everybody was much happier, my sister, and her daughter, because Mom wasn't nasty about things anymore, and mom seemed happier too, I mean, if you're not being nasty all the time that says you feel better, right?

Anyway, Good luck, I hope this helps...

PS - One suggestion I can make is when she asks about her dead relatives, don't tell her they're dead, just tell her they've gone out to get some milk or cigarettes or staying overnight with a friend or something like that. The thing is with Alzheimer's, she's never going to be able to remember, so the only way to avoid having that drama everyday of relearning the people she loved are dead is to not tell her that they're dead.  

It's a kindness to her, and takes the pressure off of you and your mom. So its a real win-win.",,,,calicoan,,,1454959291,t5_2rfqf,t3_44rrih,t3_44rrih,4,1458370807,0,0,czsiz4a,dementia,4,,
