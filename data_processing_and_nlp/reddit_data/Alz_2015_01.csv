"How is he doing mentally? Was he belligerent in his refusal to get out of bed? I'm assume this isn't the first indication of a problem and that he's been properly diagnosed with Alzheimer's at this point? My father, who is in his 80s and is in a middle stage of of the disease, came down with a virus this past holiday season while visiting with the family. We packed him off to bed for the day and when I was checking in on him I noticed that he'd wet the bed and was unaware of the fact. So having to help my pops change his pajamas and go to the bathroom... let's just say I can imagine what you're going through. I suppose in this respect I am very lucky to have a sister who has a disabled child and she's *very* good at handling these sorts of things. My mother was able to take care of things for a few years after he was diagnosed but last year we had to move them into assisted-living, which has been great but I do know it's **very** expensive. Luckily they've been well taken care of financially in this regard thanks to Blue Cross but it did take some expert wrangling. Just starting to untangle the Veteran's benefits right now. Luckily my sister has some experience in this department too.

It's not easy. Now is probably the time for you and your siblings to get together and make some decisions. It's not an easy time.

So very sorry for your situation! I can relate, being 23 and have been dealing with my father having alzheimer's since I was 17. He is now 49 and in a nursing home.

Is she at all aware that her mind is slipping or is she in denial? Because there are so many different ways she can react to someone bringing it up, depending on what she herself is aware of. The most important thing is to get her to a doctor, preferably a geriatric doctor.

"Its hard to say because Alzheimer's and other dementias generally start slowly (early onset Alz progresses more quickly though) and can have variable degrees of memory loss especially early on. Most likely you will have to wait and see if it becomes more obvious and get a doctor to diagnose it. I would get him in to see a doctor now though. You can never be too careful and the earlier you determine if this is the case the more options you will have as far as slowing the disease progression.

There are currently no effective therapies which slow the progression of the disease, however, there is a great deal of evidence connecting cardiovascular health with mental ability and memory in the elderly. This is true for Alz as well. So honestly, in either case I would recommend your father get any existing cardiovascular health issue under control (i.e. high blood pressure, high cholesterol, etc...) and try to exercise frequently.

"Edit: the thing you can do that will help on a regular basis is to give her a break and stay with him while she ""goes shopping"". If you have the time encourage her to do something fun and completely selfish while she is out. 


My SO and I are going through a similar process. Sometimes he is himself, other times he is not. This is an incredibly difficult thing to go through.  A little over a year ago we started looking for assisted living apartments. I toured most in our town, and narrowed it down to three that would be affordable. I then took my SO, to pick out a place for the future. The idea was that he would make the decision now while he was capable, and if it became too much for me I could move him in. He loved one of the places, so we started having lunch there a few times a week. We would pick a different table to sit with.  I spoke with a friend who is a neuropsychologist, she suggested that it would be an easier transition for him now rather than later. He decided he would give it a try. We booked a room on a month to month basis. It's been close to a year and a half and it may have been the best decision we have ever made. I see him daily, but the interactions we have are not lost in day to day duties, but are meaningful. We have outings like the zoo or dinner together. He stays over at the house sometimes too.   The anger still pops up from time to time, but is seldom and I can step away and still know he is cared for. Also I have noticed that it is less likely for him to continue the aggressive behavior with the workers at the complex than he is with me. I set up lunch dates for friends to pick him up and he has all the comforts of home. He has a button he can push for when he needs help, but is left to his own devices except for gentle reminders of meal times and activities that are all voluntary. At some point he may need to move to a memory wing (locked wing with strict guidelines) but for now he is safe and happy where he is. 


Unsolicited information:
One of the things I have noticed helps keep away the agitated days is sticking to a routine. Lunch and dinner around the same time, he has a few minor chores to do (making the bed etc) once a week they collect his laundry and change his sheets. On the same day he gets a haircut and beard trim. I've noticed that when we break the routine (go out late at night to celebrate a friends birthday etc) the next day he is easily confused (confusion leads to agitation for him). 

He has a very small dose of lorazepam for agitated days (we break that in half even)
They added venlafaxin as a mood elevator 
He is on a combo of aricept and numenda for dementia. 
These work for my SO, talk to your stepfather a doctor about options for him. 

A side note:
Assisted living is increasingly expensive. You can get insurance for long term stay, but it's unaffordable for your stepdad. If your mother and you don't have it now, it's time to get it.  Make sure that it covers assisted living and not just skilled nursing care. 
The places we looked were anywhere between 2000-9000 per month. 
If your stepfather was in military service check with veterans benefits. My SO managed to get a helpful pension we didn't know he would get. He was eligible after moving in to the assisted living as it took most of his income for the care they provide. There are organizations that help with medicine costs as well.

Later on, the stories would morph so that things that happened to people he knew were now ""his"" stories. In his mind, they happened to him. Another thing we saw was that certain words just escaped him (like ""remote control"" for the tv) and his mind would just seamlessly insert another word that had little connection to it.

"Thanks for this.

The doctor is the one in her area (she's in the local version of the boonies but that's not saying she couldn't go further if she had to, it's just that they're kind of liking it in what they think is their hole) and she's been going there for years.

I will definitely keep alert with those things. Already I told my father about what happened at Christmas so he knows what's going on and he'll most likely be the one to be the most vigilant, though his brother's family sees my grandparents more often than him.",false,false,t1_cncdvd5,canteloupy,,0,1420226712,t5_2r8fp,t3_2qj7pq,t1_cnccw7l,1,1425096744,0,0,cncdvd5,Alzheimers,1,,

&gt;Haley received his Bachelor's degree from Franklin College in [Franklin, Indiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin,_Indiana) in 1963. He then served as a US Army medic for a few years, before obtaining his M.S. from the University of Idaho in 1967 and his PhD in chemistry-biochemistry from Washington State University in 1971, after which he served as a postdoctoral scholar at [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University) for three years. Haley has described the research he conducted at WSU thusly: ""The guy I worked for at Washington State was a muscle biochemist. We worked together to make chemical modifications on ATP to try to identify how and exactly where ATP binds to cause muscle movement.""  From 1974 to 1985 he was a professor at the [University of Wyoming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wyoming), before being appointed first a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Kentucky, and later the chairman of the Chemistry department there in 1997.
