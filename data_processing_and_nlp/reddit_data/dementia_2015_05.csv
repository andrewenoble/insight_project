1. Continue working on getting her out of that facility.

2. Nursing homes are heavily regulated. If you are in Ohio, call the Ohio Department of Health (obviously, just change this to the state you are in). The complaint unit will hear your complaint and will work to keep you anonymous upon your request. A complaint surveyor(s) will come in to investigate. I guarantee you that you will get better care after this. Nursing home administrators and Directors of Nursing freak out if these people enter the building.Document any time that you share concerns with the staff. Document names, times, what happened. Be specific.

3.The goal for residents is not to be bed bound. If she is actually being bound to bed because she is a fall risk, this is a huge problem, and is against her resident rights.Raise enough hell and the social workers will be dying to help you get your mother to another facility. This will keep state surveyors off of their butts and will get your mother into a facility that can give her better care.

4. I hope your mother gets the care she deserves.

"/u/7242573 has very good information. 

I'm assuming you're in the US. When researching, use the [Medicare Nursing Home](http://www.medicare.gov/nursinghomecompare/search.html) tool to see ratings. See if your state publishes results of nursing/assisted living facility inspections, too. Mine does and it was helpful and had more detail than the Medicare.gov site. It had inspection report results that were more detailed.

I got names of local facilities from friends and family, and spent a lot of time on the phone. Cost, facilities, activities, etc. The exact questions depend on your grandmother's needs. Generally I tried to get the dealbreakers out of the way early to save everyone's time: 

* Are beds available? (Saves a lot of time, the answer was no at a lot of places)
* Cost (basic costs, meals, fees for additional care)?
* Facility (e.g., locked unit, availability of nursing staff, staff to resident ratio, layout of rooms, laundry, personal care, meals)
* Transportation to doctors (my dad's place has a Dr office on site, which is awesome)
* Trajectory - what happens as the disease progresses? can hospice come on-site, or does the resident have to leave?
* Specific care concerns about your loved one (for example, my dad had a Foley that needed maintenance)
* Other questions about facility and staff (amenities, activities, etc.)

My father is in an assisted living facility with a locked dementia unit which has turned out to be wonderful but that I didn't find out about until late in the process. It feels much less institutional than a nursing home. Assisted living facilities all have different requirements for residents; he was all set to go to one place until they found out he had a Foley catheter. They didn't accept patients with catheters. Another place was OK with the Foley but didn't have a secure enough facility; it would have been too easy for my father to leave unnoticed.

The only way he's affording this is long-term care insurance; his retirement savings would have been eaten up years ago.

"I am ears deep in caring for my Father who has dementia and will be 80 in a month. (Him not me :)

My Mother, his wife, died when i was 12. He never remarried or even dated and always maintained his 'Lone Eagle' status from then on. Being socially active, I firmly believe, is critical for at least staving off dementia and all that it entails. I am not saying it will STOP dementia, but i think it could have been warded off for maybe a year or two.

Also, alcohol use. He always had a beer in his hand back in the day and prolly could be considered a functioning alcoholic. He slowed his drinking maybe 8 years ago down to a beer or two a day. Then 2 years ago, he stopped altogether because he thought it keeps his mind clear by not drinking. Right around that time, i started noticing his behavior and memory starting to slip and now, he is diagnosed with moderate dementia...  he is most likely on the right side of that spectrum at this time. 

I consulted my Dr. with essentially your concerns regarding my risk factors with dementia and he said ""Eat well, sleep well, excercise your body, excercise your mind and moderation is key. Don't worry about things you can not change. You don't want to spend the next 30 years (im 46) worrying about how NOT to 'get dementia'."" 

Makes pretty darn good sense.

That all being said, 5 out of 6 of my Dad's syblings (my aunts and uncles) are suffering from dementia.

so basically, im fucked.

I would be happy to answer any other questions you may have. I just recently became my father's legal guardian. Which is why i say i am ears deep with this thing. So there are other things to consider when dementia opens the door in your life.

"Look for ongoing dementia training, and overall CARING and UNDERSTANDING and light-hearted humor of staff towards people with dementia.  Staff should know what every individuals interests are as well as their ""buttons.""  I highly recommend the book ""Creating Moments of Joy"" by Jolene Brackey which is basically a book on how to interact with those with dementia so they can feel secure and loved and SEEN.  Find a place that will SEE your grandmother inside and out.  It's easy to find a place that will feed, bathe, dress, give meds, etc.  That's easy.  It's the other, more important stuff that's difficult to find.  You want your loved one to feel connected.  You want the facility to care for your grandmother's heart and soul and internal well-being.  

One of the questions I asked every place I visited when looking for a place for my mom was -- what will you tell my mother when she asks  for HER mother?  Because in the end, these dear people usually think they are 4 years old and just want their mom and dad.  Where are they and when will they come back and get them??  I believe the correct response is to lie.  Yes, lie.  Because people with dementia do not remember what you say, they just remember how you made them feel.  What could be said to make them feel safe and secure?  Would you say, ""Oh sweetie, your mom and dad died a long, long time ago.""?  Could you imagine being told this every day and hearing it for the ""first time?""  How sad and scared that little four-year-old would be.  No, you say -- ""your mom and dad love you so much, that is why they'll be back to get you in a few hours.""  ""Would you like a snack while you wait?""  Or -- ""your mom is at the grocery store and will be back soon.  Would you like to listen to some music?""  Some places will say to distract the person, but that doesn't answer the question and leaves them anxious with unfinished business.  How would you feel if you asked for your mom and instead of answering they changed the subject?  Answer them.  Lie.  Lie about anything that would make them feel sad and scared.  Sometimes they get very agitated because they need to pick up their baby.  Their baby is waiting for them!  They don't know that their ""baby"" is 60 years old now.  Lie about their baby. The dear ones with dementia just need comfort and love.  Sometimes, quite often, this comes in the form of a lie.  A good, compassionate lie.

Okay, other than that I'd say that if money will eventually be an issue, you want to find a place where your loved one can stay if they go on Medicaid.  Not every place accepts Medicaid, and you don't want to have to move your loved one down the road as it's very disruptive.  

Finally, ask the facility how they manage end-of-life care.  Do they let an outside hospice agency come in?  What is the caregiver to resident care ratio?  A bedridden person needs to be turned every 2-4 hours by TWO people.  Will they provide this type of intensive care?  

Okay, I could go on and on.  Good luck.

"I work in nursing home rehab department. It does not matter if your mother is a fall risk, they need to get her up. to socialize, to eat, to prevent muscle atrophy, etc. This sounds like a possible neglect situation for real. Show up, and say you want to wheel your grandma around and visit with her, then they need to get her up right then and there, if not, they are in your face saying that they are too lazy or ill equipped to handle patients. The most important thing to check for is bed sores, which is skin breakdown on any part of her body, especially her buttock, hips, and heels. This is by definition neglect. 

Also, you are legally allowed to visit a nursing facility at any time 24/7, so don't feel like there is a bad time to visit. As another user has mentioned, the phone number to report neglect should be very visibly posted. If there is a complaint, even if unfounded, an inspector will drop by. 

Please feel free to ask more questions or check in. Working in these places, facilities that run like this anger me. So I am glad to discuss further if needed. 

Another thought, if you can get a chance to talk to a physician there, he may be able to order physical/occupational therapy to rehabilitate your grandma. If the facilty does not provide it, then they may be able to have her sent to a rehab facility that will take care of it, then you can discharge plan a different place in the mean time. I am not 100% sure about how this works in your area, but it is something to think about in the back of your mind.

My MIL would resist most help with toileting (by the end-before-the-end, she would actually claw and fight anyone who was a ""stranger""-- which was, of course, nearly everyone.)

Thankfully, even in the midst of her last decline, she was able to keep some sense of humor, and was able to be reassured that visits to the bathroom were normal; that we had all the time in the world to sit there or get cleaned up; and--candidly-- that life could suck sometimes, and we would all rather be at the beach. 

For us, it helped to keep things ""normal"" and light-hearted, to acknowledge (as long as we could) that this was hard, and to try to sidestep a life-time of training (that we all have) of private toileting.

"All awesome replies so far. FWIW I work in a hospital and we frequently refer patients to skilled nursing facilities for either ongoing placement or to live when their needs are too great for to return home.

In addition to asking a bunch of questions, our case managers also recommend showing-up unannounced to a facility and asking for a tour. That way, you can get a better idea of how the facility runs. It's also relevant to ask about nursing/staffing ratios. While there, check to see how responsive the nursing staff is to the patients - are they answering call lights in a timely manner or are they sitting around and checking out their phones? Doesn't hurt to check out the cafeteria as well - both for quality and quantity of food.

That being said, I also recommend another book called [The 36-Hour Day](http://www.amazon.com/The-36-Hour-Day-Alzheimer-Dementias/dp/1455521159) which is a resource most frequently recommended by our case managers.

Lastly, in case it hasn't been done already, make sure you communicate with the staff your your desires for end-of-life care. This runs the gamut of being full-code (if cardiac arrest, full efforts to revive) to strict comfort care (no IVs, limited it any medical intervention in same situation). These recommendations need to be communicated to every facility in which a patient resides and it's important that the staff understand what you do or don't want them to do in a given situation. While this can be difficult, it's much easier to do when the situation isn't happening RIGHT NOW, which is what I so often see at the hospital. Best of luck, and hope you find someplace that's a great fit!

Oh - and almost forgot - [The Joint Commission](http://www.qualitycheck.org/consumer/searchQCR.aspx#) is responsible on a national level for accrediting many different types of healthcare facilities. During your search, you can use the lookup to see how they've done on previous inspections. (As a healthcare worker, having a JCAHO inspection is a BIG deal.

If that is the case, I am not sure she has to stay at a nursing facility. Have you looked into adult family homes, assisted living, or memory care facilities?

CNAs receive about 3-6 months of training, and maybe a few additional courses for dementia care. Their job is to attend to patient basic needs like eating, toileting, bathing, and dressing as needed. Many burn out quickly, and they aren't paid very much. If they have free time they should be asking patients if they need water, want a snack, etc. Does the facility have an activities department? If they do, they should chart how often your grandma participates.

* learn something new and always keep learning (most important tip, imho. there is a concept called something like ""cognitive resource"". it basically means: the more you know, the later dementia is going to ""effect"" you, because you have a lot to ""forget"" before it becomes obvious you suffering cognitive decline)
* engage in social activities, keep in touch with friends and family, keep a lot of good company
* healthy diet, drink a lot of water
* sports
* write and be ceative
* brain activies (but don't bet on sudokus or cross-words)
* /r/nootropics might have some Ideas, but I wouldn't really recommend that as an easy tips. fish oil, antioxidents, vitamin b12 should be good. Some try to eleminate inflammation via meds, but I am not sure about this.

Tips you can use right now: before going to bed, brush your teeth with the other hand, learn a new dancemoves, instruments, langues. Discuss interesting things with friends. Do things in ways you normally dont do, for example standing only on foot. Use another way to work. Meditate. Use your brain in new ways. Learn.

All of this might not stop you from getting dementia, but it might decrease the risk and lets you have a net of social support. The last one is really important, too. (Later on) you should have a structured day so you can easily keep your normal day when you get dementia (see nunstudy) and the social net can help you. Tips: vitamin b12 + vitamin d3.

There are a plethora of interventions that nurses will try to help with fall risks. While I don't know the extent of her dementia, there are things that can be addressed to reduce the frequency of her falls (meds, therapy/wellness programs, diet, environment modifications). A good nursing team is going to look at what is consistent about her falls, and putting interventions in place to make sure these instances dont repeat. 

What is the nursing assistant to resident ratio on any given shift there? If there is a 10:1 ratio, this isnt that bad. However if there are 50 residents on the floor and only 2 nursing assistants per shift (25:1), there is simply no way she is getting the supervision she needs. 

Ask your social worker for a ""care conference."" They may be called something else at that facility, but basically these are meetings set up with nursing, therapy, dietary, and social services. Most states have requirements on how often these have to be held anyway. The social worker sets this up for you and will lead it. You'll have a chance to ask questions and share grievances. This is the time to get good info. What interventions are they putting in place to keep her from falling? Why are they keeping her in bed all the time? She has a right to be up! (This is the time to share those concerns). 


If you arent getting the attention you want, go directly to the administrator and let him know that you are calling the state if you dont get answers. They will listen. I promise. I guarantee you the adminsitrator will immediately contact the director of nursing and find out what is going on.

I will keep this short and to the point. It's probable he prefers her company over yours because it's love, not because it's dementia. 

As for turning down trips to church, I can't say as I blame him. Some people never cared much for it when they felt forced to go, and later in life they sometimes would rather not attend.

Every visit, i take her outside, we go out to eat and i try to show the nurses the other side of her and also try to build a relationship with the CNA and the RNs. It seems to have worked for MOST people but i think some people really lack empathy. 

I've tried to visit as much as I can but unfortunately, she lives in another city and bridge traffic is extremely horrendous (San Francisco to Alameda). 

I have seen the ombudsman number posted on the wall. I have no experience with this, i really dont want to sour the relationship between my family and the staff (in fear of retribution, making her take stronger meds, or further lack of care). I assume its confidential but it will become extremely apparent that it was me once they visit that room after i talked to the social worker and the staff about my concerns. Plus its only when my grandma has episodes, its pretty random from what i know and i dont know if they're going to catch her on a good time or a bad time. Sometimes the CNAs are really caring and some i feel like dont care at all and just sit in the corner playing with their ones while others are crying in the same room. Can you elaborate what they exactly do, in your experience? 

I will try the physician trick, i dont know if it will work but i can definitely try that. 

Thank you for your input and your opinion on this subject. ",false,false,t1_crl281z,emoney1234,,0,1432617781,t5_2rfqf,t3_379tvo,t1_crl0i8o,1,1433269766,0,0,crl281z,dementia,1,,

"It's easy for me since i'm young but for my parents they need a CNA to help out with everything. The problem is that my grandma forgets she can barely walk and ends up falling (probably why she's in bed all the time), they angle the bed where the head portion of the bed is down and the legs are up and stuff the sides of the bed where its extremely difficult for her to crawl out of bed. I really hate that they angle the bed and have protested against it telling the head nurse that it makes it more traumatic for her but i still catch them doing it at times.

I used to work for the school district as a special needs aide and after school programs and what they're doing would've fallen within emotional neglect (distress is leading to her harming herself) with CPS. I couldnt imagine anyone treating a student like this getting away with it no matter what special needs they may have. I completely understand its an extremely taxing job but to ignore someone's cries for help or distress and just being on your phone or just sitting next to them while they do that is inexcusable to me. Forcing someone to stay in bed and sleep all day shouldn't be an option. 

She does not partake in any special activities from what im aware of, i even asked that they take her to the dining room for meals but i dont even think they do that.

We need a long term care facility but it also needs to be covered by medicare/medical since we can not afford to pay for living. This makes our choices extremely limited. 

Her room is special where they have a sitter there pretty much all day. Unfortunately my place is one star at that medicare rating site, i've been looking into different places through that medicare place.

Again, i really appreciate your help. It is really nice to talk to someone in the field.

"Exactly this. OP you need not keep having her re-experience over and over and over again that he has passed. The memory doesn't and won't sink in - but the emotional distress will affect her EVERY time. Experiment with different reassuring statements- ""I'm sure he' s fine""  ""he's run to the store"" ""he told me not to worry, he's running late."" people always struggle with feeling dishonest- but those with dementia cannot change they way they process information- we have to change the way we present information- it becomes less about being absolutely factual and more about being comforting and compassionate. To insist on a reality that they cannot comprehend is a problem. Think of it like speaking with a child, would you drop all the harsh awful facts of life on them- or would you instead take into account their innocence and modify your behavior to fit their abilities and comprehension? This is not just us suggesting, this is the method of memory care professionals everywhere. Now, re the agitation, the frustration is real, I gather that!

"Further to this, go bananas.
Bananas are high in vitamin b6 (pyridoxine) - a crucial vitamin for long term memory potentiation.
Also, Brewer's yeasts like Marmite have high levels of b3, b6, and b12 which are also necessary for cognitive repair.
As we age, our ability to absorb b vitamins diminishes, which means we have to take higher levels in order to sustain our physical and mental well health.

Omega 3, 6, and 9 fish oils (available from Tesco, if you're in the UK) are doubly important, as they make up the stuff our brains are made from -- the white and the grey matter, as well as the myelin sheaths that shield our neutrons from attack from environmental stressors.

Supplementing with 1-2 grams of eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA) a day or eating a portion of oily fish like mackerel or sardines or to a lesser extent salmon a couple of times a week will improve the quality of her remaining days.

"High blood pressure and cholesterol are indicators of vascular dementia.
Potential remedies are drinking green tea and black coffee, reducing fatty meat consumption and taking regular exercise where possible.

Green tea has been shown to reduce and essentially declog the brain of beta amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles - the causation of excitotoxic and neurodegenerative stress accumulation over time.

Whereas coffee stimulates the production of bile acid from the gall bladder, aiding digestion of excess cholesterol in the liver (where cholesterol is manufactured, and not just absorbed from foods), leading to an overall reduction in cholesterol buildup.

I'd recommend 1-3 cups of either pure green tea or strong black organic coffee a day (milk inhibits the beneficial antioxidant flavonoid effects inherent in either)

Also a minimum of 20 minutes walking a day.

"&gt; Does anybody else ever think like this?
 
In short, yes, and I'm only 40 currently.  

My mother died from early onset in her mid 50's.  It very likely started somewhere her 40's with memory loss and progressed quickly.  It seemed to have a very noticeable progression of memory loss, once she couldn't hide it anymore (which was when she lost her job for being ""forgetful"" in her late 40's).

Mine has gotten worse as I've gotten older.  I'd always figured it was my seizure medication + cumulative effects of seizures frying my brain long term...but after Mom...I'm not so sure any more.  I've been working in the same field for a long time, and even something common I would talk about every day I sometimes forget.  Even when its explaining ""common"" things, answering the phone or giving out the phone number.  Thankfully we have (generally) understanding clients, and I can pass things off oftentimes as ""not sleeping well"" or ""not enough caffeine Hahaha!"" but I hate sounding so...stupid...to everyone when you forget things.

Its frustrating and scary in the larger picture.  I try not to dwell on it or I'd probably cry ;)  I do think on it though so I can decide what I want to do long or short (?) term.
