&gt;The __mini–mental state examination__ (__MMSE__) or __Folstein test__ is a sensitive, valid and reliable 30-point questionnaire that is used extensively in clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment.  It is commonly used in [medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine) and allied health to screen for [dementia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia). It is also used to estimate the severity and progression of cognitive impairment and to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time; thus making it an effective way to document an individual's response to treatment. The MMSE's purpose has been, not on its own, intended to provide a diagnosis for any particular nosological entity

The LCSW who suggested this seemed to think putting it in writing would be a good idea. While I agree that it seems a bit like a newsletter to send this in an email, I'm not sure that it would be practical to attempt in-person or phone conversations about it. I think this because any time that the friends who I want to disclose to are around, my Mom is present. I can't imagine a discreet way to have an in-person meeting with my Mom's friends without it being awkward or obvious to my Mom that people are talking about her. This is also complicated by the fact that myself and my sister, her two most competent caregivers, do not live in her hometown.

First, none of the data presented is *experimental*, i.e. introduce Borrelia, and cause the plaques associated with AD.  

AD is a fairly common condition in the elderly, who have been through a lifetime of exposure to a wide variety of toxic agents and bacterial infections, etc, so it is easy to find a group that show *some* correlation of AD, or AD-like pathology, with *some* other factor.

Second, while there *might* have been a reason to associate Borrelia and Lyme disease with AD at some point in the past, this has been disproven:

"I work with clients like this frequently. The Montessori tasks are great, such as the folding towels example. Some of the others I have found successful are in this article:
1. Prep tables with materials for activities such as puzzles, sorting exercises and other games.
2. Lay out a basket of clean towels to fold.
3. Have a basket of clean socks that need to be matched and folded.
4. Put out a bin of plastic plumbing tubes that can be connected and put together.
5. For advanced dementia patients who may take comfort in holding dolls, a series of dolls and doll clothes can make for a pleasurable activity.
6. For those who enjoy cooking or baking, a safe kitchen environment and baking ingredients.
http://www.alzheimers.net/2014-05-27/montessori-method-dementia/
Depending on the client, talking about their childhood can be successful. Asking questions such as where were you born? did you grow up on a farm? And then go from there depending on their answers. Simple oral quizzes, keeping in mind their level of functioning, is great too! We have whole binders where I work, but I'll see if i can find an example online...
K like this:
1 A cake named after a baseball play

2  President Carter’s favorite cake

3  Integrated cake named after a stone

4  Cake that is like a babies

5  A 16 ounce cake

 ANSWERS  # 1  Bunt cake   #  2  Peanut cake   #  3  Marble cake   #  4  Bottom cake   #  5  Pound cake

I find that when all else fails, everybody loves taking about food. Talk about what her favourite thing to cook is, does she like sweet or savoury? Things like that. 

And in crisis moments, I find that validation therapy is effective. Live in her world. If she is concerned about something, try to help her with it, validate that those feelings she is experiencing are real, before trying to redirect her to something else.

"My grandmother is nearing the end stage of Alzheimers. I know exactly what you're feeling. It does suck, it sucks every day. It is horrible watching the person you once knew just completely stop being that person. 

The first step is to accept it. You have to accept the fact that everyday from now on forward will be her best day. You have to accept the fact that your grandmother is gone. You have to accept that eventually your grandmother will be a shell and you will have to tend to her every need. It may sound crude but its the truth. 

My grandmother lived with me for 21 years. I am now 25. We would watch the golden girls together, cook together, she would watch me during the summer, we would walk together in the rain, she would always show me how to be the best person I could possibly be. I have loads of memories of this wonderful woman I was lucky to call my grandmother. But now she cant tell me what hurts, what she wants to eat, she cant walk or do anything for herself. She is fully dependant. 

Now, I park outside of their apartment and cry. I cry because my grandmother is gone, her body is all thats left. But I still love the visits. Now I take care of her the way she took care of me. But even now, her personality comes out. Not often, but it does. Shes still in there and she still loves the way a grandmother loves. Even though she doesnt say i love you anymore I know she loves me and I love her to death. 

My point is that this disease is horrible. It not only effects the person but everyone who loves this person. It is soul crushing. I know the pain all to well. To see my mom and uncle crushed. To see everyone so hurt by this. All you can do is be there for your grandmother the way she was for you. Love her the way she loved you. Hug and kiss her. Be there. Thats all you can do.

"As her DPOA, your brother should be able to tell them that he is to be contacted about any and all tests. If they don't contact him first, I would recommend that he refuse to pay the bill and make the nursing home do it. 

I worked in a nursing home with Alz patients and generally the hospital would only do an MRI if they suspected a head injury. 


That said - if she's falling often enough that this is a frequently recurring problem, you may want to look into moving her elsewhere anyway.

"Weird... When my grandma fell her doctor refused to do any tests, but eventually ordered an xray of her hip. I had to hold her in place so the tech could take the xray! How the fuck do they get her to lay still for an MRI?? If she's in hospice I'm surprised they're even bothering with tests like that, we have to cry for DAYS to get simple things like antibiotics for infected heel sores. As power of attorney your brother has the right to refuse medical treatments/intervention on behalf of your mom. However, a recent NPR story discussed a dementia patient being cared for by a facility that took a family to court and won, the facility kept feeding her because she (a patient with advanced dementia) asked for it, despite previously (when functioning) asking to no longer be fed once she was in this advanced stage of dementia.
