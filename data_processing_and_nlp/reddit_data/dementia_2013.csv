"read this article when I was in California a few months ago taking care of my mom (Stanford Ph.D., mid-80s, early dementia); it was a trying time for me, being with someone 24/7 who had virtually no short-term memory, and often had major paranoid episodes in the evenings

even after a few weeks, it was such a trying time for her that she used to break down daily, letting all her defenses down, and plead with me to just hug her

it's a great article and I hope everyone can read

"As a person diagnosed with dementia this is really interesting to me.  I don't think brushing your teath extra vigorously is the answer.

I actually had a tiny puss ulcer when I was a teen that went away under a molar.  This was the first tooth for a cavity, to be crowned and now just recently pulled.  On my own accord, I opted to have it pulled instead of the industry's ""we must save every tooth"" with them drilling the nerve out (forget what it's called).  Anyway it was infected, and I was placed on 10 days of antibiotics.

I am doing better since, but can't say that has any scientific merit (i.e., could be just stress).  I can say since being pulled my bite has been the best ever.  Leading me to believe that the tooth had been swollen and infected for a long  time.

So, how often and how well does the industry spot infections?  When I told the Dentist about the puss as teen he inspected and said to watch it.  This was months of the event.  So I looked for another sore to happen, and if so I would go to the dentist -- it never did those decades.  So what if I had an infection my entire life?  I know for sure that viral is possibility for my condition (technically labeled encephalopathy).  I also know I had a high white blood cell count in my mid 30s where the doctor took another test and I was just below the threshold and said it must have been a cold.  I know I suffered chronic fatigue symptoms all my adult life that I then attributed to chronic pain, but wondered if something else so paid close attention to my health (doctor appointments, exercise, and clean living).  I, however am fairly certain I had undiagnosed epilepsy as well too (shrugs).

So, back on point.   I really don't think they know (e.g., here's this article in the 21st century).  So I *THINK* this is a classic example of industries having different turf war going on.  If you look up dentistry and medical doctors they don't license and exist under the same umbrella.  The former existed first and the later probably mocks dentists.  Who is left behind to fall through the crack -- us.  I know I did!

What's interesting I took years of tetracycline for acne in my early adult years.  Look that up for nasty side effects and that's the healthiest I probably was.  I quit because of education and not wanting to be on medicine and my fatigue increased -- messed up.

tl;dr your tooth brush has the bacteria on it and isn't reaching your brain anyhow.

It is doubtful that THC has any real medicinal use in vivo or in humans for AD.

"Ok, I am going to be as blunt as possible, don't take it personally. 

Concerning the medications: Do not blame her, she has dementia and she is going to forget. As family that has a toddler running around, it is your responsibility to make sure she doesn't leave open pill bottles around. If you can (or your mother), put the pills somewhere where she cannot find them. And you guys be responsible for giving her pills to her at pill times. 


How often does your mom make her shower? Does she help her? At the facility that I work at, the residents bath/shower once a week, but they get a good wash, down there, twice a day. If it is a huge hassle, it is not going to hurt her to not shower more than once a week. We have something called 'gentle care' in place. If a resident is sleeping in the morning, we don't wake them and let them stay in bed. If they get violent and don't want us changing them before bedtime, fine, they don't get changed. It is less stressful for everyone involved.


If she doesn't like when you ask how her day is going, try asking in different ways, because it could be the way you are asking. Try different tones and different wording. If she keeps getting mad, stop asking. I was taught that if a resident is aggressive towards you or refuses any care, try different ways and different times. If nothing helps, get someone else, because it could be you.


As for how she eats and doesn't take care of her diabetes: They can be stubborn. I am honestly not sure what you can do here. How advanced is her dementia? Do you have a blood glucose tester for her? Because as long as her blood sugars stay around a certain amount, it shouldn't be too too bad. It's not good, but there is not much you can do. Are you able to maybe ration out some of the sweets? like a couple cookies for snacks and desserts? 


I hope that some of this helps or you are able to figure out what to do. Good luck!

That could be a different sibling (my mom respects my sister more than me, because she's successlful and sort of famous), for instance, or someone else that's higher up the food chain than both you and the person with dementia. So I might respond to one of my mom's meltdowns: ""look, your daughter says the book can't be found. That's all I know."" And I have to be firm when I tell her.

That's one trick. The other thing I learned is that logic doesn't work. Period. So I don't ever try to reason with my mom anymore. She can no longer think logically. That's a big heartbreaker for me, because she has a Ph.D. from a big name university.

"Thank you for sharing your story. I, too, am very close with my grandfather.

I am 28 and have been my grandma's caregiver since I was 19, and my grandpa's since I was 23. My grandma suffers from dementia and Parkinson's and a dozen other ailments. She has good and bad days...

Your mother is very wise! You absolutely have to laugh. This summer my grandma spent five days in the ICU, her kidneys failing due to a UTI that went septic. One day, I overheard her say to the nurse's aide, ""The next time I ring the bell, you better show up or I'm going to kick.. your.. fuckin'.. ass. NOW... I would like some water please, Brian."" This coming out of the classiest lady I've ever known... it may have been the second time I ever heard her cuss? I could NOT stop laughing... that poor aide.

What struck me most about your post is near the end...

&gt; ""Are you sorry you went?"" she asked me. ""No,"" I answered without missing a beat. As much as it shook me, I wouldn't have passed it up.

As a caregiver I find myself constantly poking and prodding my family to visit my grandma. It's true that she's not the same person anymore, but she is still a person. The matriarch of the family... the same woman who cradled and loved me and held all the broken pieces of our family together is gone. She left long ago, but remains a prisoner of her own mind. 

No one should have to be alone at the end, even if they can't remember your name. And while the heartbreak is overwhelming, seeing it is so much better for you than not knowing. You get that confirmation, a sort of pre-closure... to see someone in that state makes it... *not easier*, but more of a relief for them when they do pass away.

I think it is very beautiful that you and your mother sang to your grandfather. Please keep singing for him, and keep sharing your story! He should be very proud of you.",false,true,t1_ccvkhjm,caresbricks,,0,1382272516,t5_2rfqf,t3_1otc5e,t3_1otc5e,3,1429065307,0,0,ccvkhjm,dementia,3,,

"I think first and foremost the best thing would be to take your dad to visit his GP. Go along with him to support him, if he has signs of dementia it will be easier to share the symptoms with his doctor as he may not remember or even be aware of them. You said he is on a waiting list to see a specialist so it sounds like you're already on your way to doing this. He will probably feel confused/upset/scared- offer your support and ask if you can accompany him as you would like to learn more about it too. 

If your dad does have dementia, the best thing you can do to help your him is find out as soon as possible what his wishes are and make notes of these. Remember though, you need to be taken into consideration too. He may want you to run the shop but this of course might not be possible- try to reach a mutual agreement about this early on. 

The shop is clearly something that is very important to him. Why not take photos/videos of the shop how it is now- the way it's laid out, him cashing up at the end of the day etc so if someone else ends up running it, he can be shown these and reassured you have taken the time to learn how he feels it should be run? At worst it will be a nice memory for him to look back on. 

I agree with others, if your dad does retire he certainly needs to remain active. There's plenty of things out there that his dementia won't and shouldn't inhibit. Start looking out now for social clubs, dementia cafes, dementia singing classes, gardening groups- anything you think your dad might enjoy. He might find some new hobbies along the way. Your GP should be able to point you in the direction of services that specialise in dementia that will have a list of programs your dad could join. 

Are you in the UK? If so I would recommend www.carersuk.org as a first point of call- they will link you with services to help both your dad and you. 

Finally, and most importantly, you are not a terrible son. You obviously care a lot about your dad and his future. It's a really difficult and upsetting disease for both the individual and those who care for them. Help to look after your dad by looking after yourself too. 

All the best for you, you dad and the rest of your family.

"This is a beautiful poem! My dad suffered from dementia for 5 years before he died. It was very painful for all concerned. I didn't ""process"" it well at all. It happened so quickly, I wasn't in good shape myself. I wasn't able to protect him from fear, confusion, distress and the abuse my sister and mother created by fighting over him. 

I made him a lot of little art works and put them all over his room. He would wheel himself around the room looking at each as if for the first time and they made him happy. Some had little poems and bits of songs he knew, simple funny songs. He would sing and want me to join and I would. 

Now I think of how it would be to be demented myself. I think it might not be as agonizing as it was for my dad as long as I wasn't asked to do more than I could do. I imagine I could be happy to doodle and color and that sort of thing in a childlike way and that kind of life might be OK.

My dad was always very distant and formal but after the dementia, he became extremely loving and caring and sweet. The one thing that mattered to him more than anything else towards the end of his life was whether we knew how much he loved us. He would ask us very anxiously many times a day if we knew how much he loved us. That was very precious to me. We exchanged a look of love one day that erased decades of issues in an instant.

When the individual wanders off and leaves the preset geozone, you are quickly notified via an email or SMS text to your mobile phone. The service also provides emergency tracking in case you need to locate a loved one immediately.

"Um...sometimes it has to do with family dynamics that were set in place before dementia became an issue. Burned bridges and whatnot. Sometimes I think that the family assumes that since they can't remember who they are, that there is no use in visiting, which couldn't be farther from the truth. Just because they dont remember you, doesn't mean you dont visit. Go and try to relate to them in things that they can still understand or remember. Sing songs they used to know (very basic ones) or show them photos, or bring a pet if they like animals, or talk about their early years which is something many can still remember. Almost every resident I've come across loves the one on one attention, and it doesn't matter if they can't remember you.

Sometimes it's hard not to judge family members for not visiting. I know that they have their reasons...but we are the ones who see them day after day. They wouldn't remember later on if they even had visitors...they really live in the moment, but for the people that see them every day, it makes us sad. Especially when the residents are one that we are fond of. 

Unfortunately, we often are very busy - 2 people for 12-14 residents...so it means that their basic needs are taken care of, but sometimes we dont always have the time to deal with the 1on1 that they may need when a behavior strikes. If we can take the time, which we really do try to, we sit down with them, and try to relate. Talk about their careers, their family, etc...to get them off the thoughts of whatever made them react badly in the first place. If that doesn't work, we leave them alone (as long as they are safe) for 10-15 minutes and then re approach. Often that does the trick. Sometimes getting another co-worker can work, as I've been mistaken as a sister or family member, and when that happens, its best to just leave the situation. If they think I am their younger sister trying to tell them they need to use the bathroom, it makes them angry and its best to have someone different help out, if that makes sense. 

Preparing for the day is basic. I work an 8 hour day, and get a 30 minute lunch break. I dont do much, except try to make sure that I'm well hydrated as it is very warm...elderly don't have much tolerance for air conditioning in the summer!

I'm not sure why the full moon affects them...it affects many people, not just elderly...children often get rowdier or moodier during the moon too. And sometimes people dont sleep well, etc. With dementia, if it affects them, the only way they really know how to express the changes is to act out. Sometimes it means they have weird sleeping hours for a couple days (up all night or restless) or sometimes it means they are a little more challenging to cooperate. It is similar to sundowning, but usually goes all day long for a few days. 

I dont work evenings, but I have been told that certain residents that act fairly normal during the day, change their moods a lot at night. Big sundowners. It's hard on the workers, and even for the families if they see it, so many families choose to visit during the day if possible. 

I really do enjoy the residents. The pay isn't great, so it makes it hard to love the work, but interacting with everyone is mostly usually good :) I have a couple residents who I have a good relationship with, and sometimes I can get them to cooperate for me when they wont for others...so its nice to know that everyone is essential.

"Hi there!  I have worked as a caregiver for patients with dementia from both TBI and from Alzheimer's Disease.  I also do some health education on the topic as well.  

What are some of your frustrations as a caregiver?
When there is no preplanning or early diagnosis especially where AD is concerned.  So much could be helped if people prepared for this in advance.  Also when there are several family members in charge of care for the patient but there is not one feasible cohesive plan.  It's just a mess.  
-As a caregiver, what are some of the things you do to help you cope?
Alcohol.  Partially kidding.  It helps for me to have a good support system to talk to others who do what I do and can understand my frustrations.  
-Do you feel as if there is enough information/help to assist you in caring for your loved one?
I feel there is but some people don't know how to get it or are to worried with stigma to attain it.

If so there are several carers (which is what you have now become) organisations that will have a depth of knowledge and support for you.

Similarly, I'd really recommend speaking to your doctor about this. With a diagnosis for your husband your GP must have taken into consideration the impact this will have on you and your daughter. Make an appointment and share your concerns with them- again they will be able to direct you to the right support; be it lawyers, carers forums, respite care, counselling services etc.

In my experience working with seniors, it is most commonly caused by medications. As seniors age, their bodies become less able to efficiently process medications.

The most common  metals implicated in AD and more well accepted currently than Al are iron, copper, and zinc mainly due to their concentrations being found to be several times higher than the initially reported Al levels in AD and that a misregulation of these metals are known to be detrimental.

"I have been a caregiver for about 2 years at a private nursing home specifically geared towards dementia. Some have Alzheimer's, some do not. 

A frustration that I particularly get on a daily basis is families not visiting their loved ones. Granted, I dont know their history, and there may be things that dictate their visits or lack there of, but theres a few residents who in the time I've been there, I could count their visitors on less than one hand. It makes me sad to see these old people who have nothing left, and who took care of their kids when they were young, to see them left alone when they need people. And that their kids pay 10k per month to have them live at our facility, and then dont provide new clothing, or basic necessities. A few residents, WE have actually spent our own money providing small things for them because we got so frustrated at families not giving a shit.

I know that isn't how all families are, for sure. But some are and it hurts to know that we care more about their well being.

In the CARE aspect, some things that can be a challenge are behaviors. When I arrive in the morning, I never know what awaits me. We have a few residents who can be especially difficult, and I can take the same approach with them daily, and have it always turn out different. Around the full moon, people are particularly worse, and it's just something we deal with. Behaviors dictate a lot of other things as well. If I can't get someone to go to the bathroom, then I know it's a matter of time before they wet thru their depends, and that creates more work for me, and more embarrassment and frustration for the resident. We can't force anyone to do anything, so it's just something that comes along with the job.

As a caregiver, some things that help me deal with the frustrating aspects of my job is being able to laugh. Yes, Alzheimer's is a sad disease, but if you're only ever sad then it will burn you out quickly. Sometimes the residents do or say such funny things! And you laugh with them and it cheers you up, and makes them smile.

I don't know if it's my personal situation taking here, but I think that starting the meds as early as possible is a good idea. Nothing can stop the progression, but there are medications that can slow it down. The thing that I have been told in the past, and that I have definitely noticed myself, is that if you start the medicine you need to stay on it.

"You didn't give a lot of information so here's what works for us.

We tend to stick with things that are sweeter for my granddad's Alz.  The only things he is willing to eat without coaxing or persuasion is Chocolate Mini Wheats, bananas, snack cakes and cookies.  He won't eat anything savory, so we make things like meatloaf or pulled pork/chicken made with a honey bbq sauce in the crockpot.  We also make salmon cakes fried in coconut oil (the oil imparts a little sweetness).  These also have a softer texture, which seems to appeal to him.  I don't think I could get him to eat a steak or a chicken breast at this point.

When I prepare vegetables, I add a little sugar in the pan.  We do corn, green beans, and carrots this way.  He's also fond of cinnamon apples, so I keep those for every dinner meal.  Sometimes he will sit down to just eat the apples and end up eating everything on his plate when he realizes he's hungry.  Sometimes a bribe food like cinnamon apples will pay off.

I know you probably weren't looking for advice like adding a little sugar to healthy foods, but if that's what it takes to get her to eat, then better that than not at all.  We can usually get him to eat one reasonably healthy meal a day by working with his sweet tooth rather than against it.

The other thing we've had to consider is that the meal times for the rest of the family don't coincide with his cycle.  Our dinner time is his breakfast.  He takes his long sleep from about 10am to 4pm so for him, serving a dinner type meal at 3am works.  I know this isn't convenient for most people, but I am in a position to be able to stay with him 24 hours a day, so I can be on his schedule.

Don't overlook supplements such as Boost, Ensure or even Carnation Instant Breakfast.  Those can help cover the vitamins and minerals she's not getting in her diet.  Sometimes when he just won't eat real food, I do chocolate Boost powder, milk and a banana in the blender.

"I am so sorry for your situation.  I was 11 years old when my mother was diagnosed with early-onset alzheimer's disease.  A very different time for both of us as individuals.  

My dad worked nights and took care of my mother during the day.  I went to school during the day and took care of my mom at night.  I had no social life and told only two friends, the rest just found out by word of my mouth.  I felt like most people don't understand or truly care, so it wasn't worth my time telling them.

Eventually we needed to place her into an intergenerational non-profit day care run by a church, which was wonderful for my mother.  She went so quickly and was placed into a nursing home 2 years after her diagnosis.  She died about 3 months after that- her rapid brain change caused a grand maul seizure. 

It became too difficult for me to see my mother in that state. Sometimes she didn't remember who I was.  I remember the shock on my friend's faces as they saw that event. 

We were so in denial with the diagnosis, and the doctor said ""the younger they are, the quicker they go."" We were so mad we switched doctors, but he was so right. 

We should have taken precautions so much earlier, we went completely broke from all the care we had to give her.  We let her drive when she shouldn't have been driving- one time she drove on the wrong side of the freeway.  We let her have money and house keys when she was mentally unable to handle such responsibilities.  We didn't want to rob her of everything in her life.

I feel so good thinking about who my mother was before Alzheimer's, knowing she was such a wonderful person, and so sad that she was robbed of her beautiful mind.  I am happy that I did take care of her in such a fragile state.  There's no denying this will be a hard time for you, but I think you should look through old pictures with her as much as possible.

"Get diagnosed by a doctor- it's the only way to accurately rule out the several possible ways he could have these symptoms (or the lack of symptoms at all). It's possible that you, with your anxiety and his recent amnesia problems could be scrutinizing his behavior more closely and seeing dementia symptoms that aren't there, but it's also possible that delaying diagnosis could mean delaying treatment for a condition that is curable or treatable.

As to your first question: Does he have any upcoming checkups since he has had those recent troubles? It might be possible to call ahead and try to get the doc to administer a few additional tests or to watch out. Otherwise, it can be really difficult to get a person to get diagnosed but you might try to go through a person or use examples to explain it to him that he will find very credible.

Your second question depends entirely on the answer to your first question- if he is having problems stemming from his TGA incident or some other health problem that can be resolved, things could work out with treatment. It's also possible, as I mentioned, that he isn't sick but is just slowing down a bit as he gets older.

There is actually a huge volume of literature and research on these sorts of things- your local library or university may have some information but also if you have a local Alzheimer's Association office they may have a library which should include some books or literature specifically about activities for dementia sufferers.

One thing I can recommend from personal experience is music, specifically music that is familiar to your patient. If her family could give you some recommendations or load them onto an ipod for you, some dementia patients are very responsive and can be quickly calmed by music that is familiar to them. You will need an ipod or a shuffle that you are not too concerned with losing (it will be more likely to be stolen by staff than residents) and a dock or some headphones that your patient can tolerate, and you will need music that works- if you have no contact with family this will be trial-and-error.",false,true,t1_c8l36pe,hithazel,,0,1361757495,t5_2rfqf,t3_194e75,t3_194e75,0,1431396529,0,0,c8l36pe,dementia,0,,
"Through speaking to others, and in my experiences with my grandma who has dementia, it seems best to validate their concern when the situation allows. My grandma will often speak about dead relatives. In the past I tried correcting her. Once I even took her to visit the grave-site of some dead relatives just to prove they were dead. After doing that and thinking about it for a while, I concluded that that was the wrong approach for two reasons. One, she didn't remember going to the grave-site an hour after we returned home, and two, I imagine that something like that could potentially be very shock-inducing and upsetting to the person with dementia, though thankfully my grandma responded very calmly to the visit. I explained to her what was happening and gave her a minute alone with the deceased to pray or whatever she wanted to do. I've found that confusion seems to be the part of the disease that causes the most trouble. 

When I said that validation depends on the situation, I mean it's best to validate their concerns when it will cause no harm to themselves or anyone else, and when it allows for potential conflict to be passed over smoothly. In your situation, you can't very well let your mother drive anywhere. I would try to get her talking about something else travel related until the topic changes organically, or telling her that she can drive on the return trip home or ""next time"", but dad is driving this time. 

Finally, I'm not a healthcare professional. Everything I just said could be totally wrong in your situation. I'm just a dude trying to do my best in dealing with this terrible disease. Please use caution with whatever approach you decide on using with your mom.

"Third. Similar source. 
I would just comment, regarding your question, ""What are we supposed to do for her?"" that if you are caring for someone with dementia, many people always feel like there is more they should be doing, but the reality may be that you are doing everything you can. Even when you may be doing every thing that you possibly can be doing, it may never feel like you're ""enough"". It's natural to want to do more, and to think there is more that can be done. You sound like you care about her, and you don't want to see her like this. But if she has dementia, the harsh reality is that it doesn't go away. You can't ""make her better"", but you can take good care of her. However, no matter how well you care for her, it's going to be messy, and unpleasant, and draining. It doesn't mean you and your family are doing anything wrong. You do the best you can. And it doesn't mean your grammy is doing anything wrong. She can't help it. She's sick with a disease. It's sometimes hard for us to believe we can't change the person, and it's really hard with dementia because we can't ""see"" the disease. The person still looks the same as the person we've known all our lives, but the mind, the part we can't see, has changed. The best advice I can give you is to try to meet her on her level. One thing that won't work is lecturing her or trying to use logic or arguments, because if her dementia has become bad, she isn't able to understand anymore, she just can't. Like what Kendar said, try using a different tone, or a different approach, or do your best to look for alternate explanations for the behavior. If she won't shower, try to understand why she won't shower. Is it possible she's afraid of something? Maybe falling? (people with dementia lose the ability to ""say"" what they want and need, and sometimes if they become aggressive it's their way of expressing discomfort or fear or maybe frustration with their own confusion). Maybe being in a small confined space? If she craves sweet food and is really insistent on it, is it possible that it's maybe one of the few comforts she has (when old people are sick they lose their independence, and so they're not able to do a lot of the things that used to bring them pleasure... often food is one of the last remaining pleasure). Could you get her diabetic candy instead?

"Dementia is diff for everyone, so predicting the future is difficult. It also greatly depends on what (if any) his diagnosis is. Alzheimer's is a long slow progression, traditionally hitting people that are older, and it's MANY years of a slow decline unless another health problem comes up. But there's also dementia related to brain conditions (tumor, etc) or cancers, or other diseases. 

Also forgetfulness and occasional odd behavior is also part of getting older. It doesn't always mean the worst. You should start documenting when/what his odd behaviors are. This way if the time comes to consult a dr, you have some examples to back you up. Also, ask other people that may see him when you don't, to tell you about concerning behavior.

Increasing cognitive stimulation can decrease the progression of the symptoms; similar to the medications.

"random_pattern is spot on.  You have to realize your mom really believes what she is saying, I always found with my dad it was pointless arguing with him.  He just got more stubborn and I just got more hurt.
Imagine this, my dad walked into my office once and said ""I want you to take your chequebook out and give me back the $167,000 you stole from me""  Dad had held a mortgage for my husband and I which had been paid back years earlier.  He was convinced I ""stole"" that money by not paying it back.  I found when my dads dementia got worse, simply changing the subject would work or leaving the situation would of course get him to stop.  He always revisited the same stories though.  Your mom may never let this book thing drop.  My dad never let the money thing go.
random_pattern is right, you can't reason with them.  I know how much it hurts, I noticed with my dad the more I let him go on about it the more agitated he would get.

"I am 20 and am on a leave of absence this semester to be at home. My 56 year old mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's 4 years ago but just over this last 6 months has taken a remarkable turn for the worst. She cannot remember new people or experiences, and cannot process transitions at all (such as riding in a car or walking from the living room to the kitchen for a meal). When I came home for Christmas I finally had the experience I had been fearing the most: she didn't recognize me.

The part I have found the hardest is that this disease has taken her from the level headed, reserved, kind woman I was raised by, and made her into an erratic, angry, dependent being. Even with a slew of caregivers/professional companions, getting her into clean clothes everyday is a struggle, she has lost 15 pounds, and she has begun to wander out of the house and into the neighborhood. I am home now because I realized this is her last year living at home.

"I'm so sorry for the delayed response. I was caught up with work and away from Reddit for a couple days. That's a good point... if it were another debilitating disease you might have more support. Dementia is so insidious. I'm reluctant to give suggestions because I'm a complete stranger and not in your shoes, but if I were to give you advice I'd encourage you to as best as possible try to keep in mind that the way your parents are acting and the things that they're saying... that's not your parents, it's the disease. It looks like your parents and uses the voice of your parents, but it's not them. I know you know that already, but just a suggestion to keep it in the forefront of your mind and maybe it will take the edge off some time. Also, my second suggestion would be to get in a good routine of taking care of yourself. I mean, do healthy things for yourself. This might seem silly, but people in your shoes sometimes call it 'the long goodbye', and it's definitely somewhat of an endurance test. One of the most difficult things can be that it's such a long process, and how do you as the caregiver endure that. Do what you can to set healthy boundaries and take care of your mind and body and do things that are enjoyable. I'm sorry to hear you have to go through this alone. I don't know why it is that so often when someone is ill it comes down to one person alone stepping up to the plate.

"My grandmother suffered from vascular dementia during the last six months of her life.  Not only did she not recognize me, but would say hurtful things about her granddaughters including me.
