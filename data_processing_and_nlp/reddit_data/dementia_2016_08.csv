"You might consider filing for disability (before the GOP takes it away). Depending on where you reside there may also be work programs for people with cognitive/memory issues; I know they have such programs in my County. 

You could also try to get a prescription medicine called Provigil. I was able to get it because I have sleep apnea and also have early onset dementia, which impacts my memory. The Provigil helps with that. 

I would suggest you go and have a look at the /r/nootropics and /r/stackadvice subreddits, as well as my own /r/oldernoots for more information about Over The Counter Smart Drugs. They have helped me a lot.

I lost my last job as a project manager because of cognitive/memory issues as well. I was lucky that I was old enough to get into Social Security at the time, so I applied for that and Disability and am now fully retired.

"Firs of all: if its a recurring problem, you should take her to see the doctor. as others write, it might be something that he can help with - maybe she needs something for her digestion, maybe there is an ulcer, whatever.. 

i work in my school holidays as a caregiver at a nursing home, sometimes they will say things like this, that they need something for their stomach, more out of habit than anything else. I.e. they feel ""something"" is wrong, but they can't quite place what it is, because often that feeling is more psychological than physical and related to the dementia, but because they cannot express that, they will say its the stomach. The ones complaining often get some prune juice: it is really good for the stomach and helps with digestion (which can in fact suffer if they have this feeling of unease, and cause the stomach aches). As you write, she keeps asking cause she doesnt get anything, so just the whole placebo effect, the feeling of ""being heard"", of getting something to help with the stomach might really help her a lot, to calm her down and help get rid of the feeling of unease. Say the prune juice is for her stomach and it will help, maybe this is enough to help her :)

To keep her occupied: Music from when she was young and old movies, that she know, are great occupations. Also, if anyone in the family has a pet that can come visit, this can really help with cheering up :) does she know how to knit or do anything with her hands?

"I don't personally have experience w/elder care attorneys, I didn't handle any of the paperwork etc. I am only involved with the ""hands on"" care, not any of the legal stuff. Other people in the family handled that. As it stands, two family members share POA (financial) and guardianship (medical). It was an extremely emotional &amp; difficult process, because my family member refused to do either, so it went through court &amp; Adult Protective Services, and then the two guardians conflicted as to what they wanted. Many lawyers were involved. I highly recommend that you see one, because this stuff can get tricky, especially with finances. It's expensive, but a good lawyer will help make obtaining guardianship etc easier for you. 

Getting him back onto Seroquel sounds like a good idea, even if he only takes it at nighttime or at a lower dose. I understand the concern for falling etc, but honestly.. if it makes him peaceful and calm, it's worth it. The memory care unit is generally smaller and self-contained, so they'll be able to keep a closer eye on him. I can see how they wouldn't be enthused about it in the AL section, but it may be different in the MC section. The transition between one med to another can be rough, especially if they didn't wean him off slowly and build up slowly (I really, really hope they did!). Any abrupt changes in meds will result in an abrupt change in behavior. I'm sure they understand this. That's awesome that you have a good psych nurse on your side. 

It sounds to me like a 5150/geri psych inpatient stay probably won't be necessary. It might be a really rough transition, but it sounds like the AL/Memory Care place he's in is willing to work with him, on meds &amp; behavior. I honestly think that if they weren't confident they could handle him, they wouldn't have offered him to move to Mem Care in the first place--they would've said ""He needs more than we can offer him,"" and encouraged you to look elsewhere.

" One of the great difficulties I've had in caring for my mother, who is in now in the final stages of dementia, is importantly accepting where she is, and how she understands the world. 

As a result most times, I'm sure looking back, I was responding to her as if she was in a world she was not. I'd tell her, for instance, that I was going to the shop and would be back in an hour, knowing full well that she did not know really what an hour was anymore, and that even if she had an idea of what it was, she had no way of telling when an hour was up, or what time had passed since I'd left. In fact she had no idea of the time at all... sometimes I'd leave the room and come back in a minute and she'd express joy at seeing me ""after such a long time"". Other times she would not know who I was when I walked back into the room after a minute or two.

What I'm saying is, that at SL4 dementia, your parents are inevitably living in a terrible world of confusion and anxiety which they hate, and you have become their chopping block for much of the anxiety and blame-gaming that goes with that. BUT, given all that and no doubt much much more, it does not change the fact that they don't know what the time or the day is, let alone what season, month or year it is, or how long it has been since they saw you, and when you were there last. 

You need to step into their world in order to make rational and emotional decisions about them which will be helpful to them, and which will also make sense of your life and your and your wife and future children's needs. 

Trouble is that stepping into how someone with dementia is experiencing their world, and such things as time, is actually a huge leap for someone sane like you, let alone for someone who wants nothing other than to pull their loved one back from that insane world of dementia and is resisting understanding their world at every step. 

But you need to do that. You need to step into their world and understand how they are experiencing it and things like time, and the time between your visits. And then ask yourself, whether it is really sane to drive 2 hours a day to see your mum, who will not remember that you've been there to visit and how long it has been since your last one. And most important of all, you need to do your mother the honour of remembering her when she was sane, and ask her, whether she would want you in these terrible circumstances to spend your time tearing your own little family apart to visit her every day? My guess, she'd say no, or course not!",,,,seedpod02,,,1470981317,t5_2rfqf,t3_4x962n,t3_4x962n,3,1473359676,0,0,d6e7urs,dementia,3,,

It's not going to help her at all if she's left alone to her own devices everyday with nothing other to do than watch TV.

"Unfortunately I know this feeling too well. 

My papa passed away on Valentines Day this year. May last year he had a fall and then he went down hill from there. From Christmas he didn't eat, from late January he couldn't even drink. Days prior he lost his speech. 

Even with the morphine and medication, somewhere deep down she knows what you are say. Tell her you love her, tell her everything you want to tell her. As hard as it is try and enjoy the last moments. My papa couldn't remember my nana had died 11 years prior, it broke my heart having to tell her she had passed away. To see him grieve all over again because I had to tell him she wasn't here any more,was one of the worst moments.. all you can do is hope she forgets that thought once again.

4 days prior to my papa passing away we had a day where we chatted about going to the beach for ice cream. We then had a sleep next to each other and we chatted in between the hallucinations and agitation. This day together helped give me closure, especially since the next day he lost his speech.

It's not going to be easy, it will prob be harder before it stops. You'll prob be wishing it would end, it's okay to think that, as you don't want to see her go through it. Also don't beat yourself up if you feel like a weight has been lifted when she does pass, it's a natural feeling. 

Best advice I could give is reassure her that its okay to go. This is probably the hardest conversation you will have, cause you know when they do, there is no way to bring them back. I put off having this conversation as I wasn't ready, but I knew i had to. He told me he didn't want to leave me as he wanted to make sure i was okay. I told him I would be fine ( even though deep down, i wasn't sure i would be if he went). I had that conversation on the Saturday night and he was gone by the Sunday lunchtime. Sometimes they just need to know, its okay to go.

After he passed away in my arms, I had left the room and broke down in the corridor. When I went back in and looked at him, it was the strangest thing as he looked happy for the first time in months now that he was at peace. It hurts so much, but remember you are not alone. 

My love and thoughts are with you, if you need to talk, i'm here. ",,,,Skiwilass,,,1470348165,t5_2rfqf,t3_4vu017,t3_4vu017,1,1473226333,0,0,d64jij1,dementia,1,,
"Know that when you cry, you don't cry alone. We are there with you. I'm sorry that this is happening to you and your family.  The follow is a bit of rambling and a few suggestions.  The suggestions may or may not help, as everyone with dementia reacts differently. Take it with a grain of salt and hopefully you will find something that works for your situation. 

I almost hate the ""good days"" because they are fleeting. Today my SO played the piano and did really well. It's been weeks since he has been able to play anything recognizable (it comes and goes) but today was great! He is more with it and happier today. I know it won't last. It may not make it through the day even. It reminds me of what he has lost and what I have lost and it's painful each time. I try to focus on the happiness durning the good times and limit anxiety (everyone's) during the bad times.  This sometimes means ""lying"". I use quotation marks because I'm not sure if it qualifies as a lie when the person you say it too can't comprehend the truth. That girl with your things? We hired her and she is bringing them later in the week. We can't leave right now because your daughter will be home soon and she won't be able to find us. I find a favorite tv show, food or song can be a well timed distraction when they are locked into a loop.  Sometimes I take a warm wash cloth and wipe down my SO's face. He closes his eyes reflexively and even though he is mad I'm asking him to hold still he enjoys the feeling and it helps him to calm down a bit. 

A final bit of unasked for advice, ask for and accept help. It's hard to accept help, I always feel a bit like I have let him down when I can't do it alone. It is simply not possible to do alone.

"I work as a geriatric psychologist in the Netherlands. LBD is distinctive from other types of dementia since it usely goes hand in hand with Parkinsonism (Parkinson like features: rigidity, bradykenisia, tremors, mask like face without expression, difficulties in swallowing etc.). 

Cognitive functioning can change on a daily basis (you constantly have to adjust your approach). One day they are quite adequate, the next day their consciousness is diminshed. LBD features could also include positive symptoms (hallucinations/delusions), proneness to bodily infections and comorbid delirious behaviours, problems in executive functioning (problem solving, task shifting, planning, mental flexibility) and attention (easily distracted, difficulty keeping up with the conversation). They could also have slower thought processes, so it takes more time to proces basic information (if this is the case present information more slowly and in small chunks). LBD is also characterized by visuospatial problems: coordinating and evaluating their movement in space which could result in being unable to properly grab a fork or spoon or walking into things (danger of falling over).


Problems in the circadian rhythm is also common: trouble sleeping at night while super sleepy during the day, or not sleepy at all..It's important to adjust to their rhythm but don't overdo it: If they can't sleep, they can't sleep. Tips concerning sleep patterns: Daylight (together with melatonin supplements) and daily 'exercise' is important. 

Other important tips concerning hallucinations and delusions:

http://www.alz.org/care/alzheimers-dementia-hallucinations.asp

AND:

People with LBD are very sensitive to Haloperidol (haldol) and is counter effective in treating hallucinations/delusions. Hopefully your doctor keeps this in mind. 

Sorry for the messy lay out, and good luck! If you have any more questions let me know.

"Do you have any experience with eldercare attorneys?  I want to ensure I am protecting my assets from his situation and that my family bears no liability for his actions.

We are in ""the most remote urban area in the Lower 48 states,"" which means that we have many good medical options, but not all the ones a less remote place would have.  There is literally one geriatric specialist MD in the area.  So a mental health hospital (there's only one in town) isn't going to have a geriatric unit, per se.   

He was on seroquel and doing really well with it, but the assisted living didn't want him on it during the daytime because of the risk of sleepiness and balance issues.  Since he wasn't on lockdown, they really didn't want him taking a walk and falling as a result of the medication.  So about 2 weeks ago, his psychiatric nurse switched him over to risperidone.  Dad is now refusing to take his evening meds (they suspect because he wants to control at least one element in his life), and so he's only getting a half-dose of anything.  We think this is why he's getting so wild.  The plan is to get him to the memory care and put him back on seroquel twice a day.  I'm not familiar with mirtazapine, but this psych nurse of his has a reputation for working miracles with meds.  Getting him to take them is the challenge, for sure.

You said, ""I just have a lot of hurt that I need to write about. Even if no one is listening,"" and """"She is my Gramma, but she also isn't my Gramma.""

She's still in there. It's just that sometimes the disease is stronger than she is.  Sometimes you don't know if you're getting past the disease to connect to her.  And sadly, sometimes you know a connection couldn't be made right then. But even near the end, there were short periods when he was my dad again.  Those brief ""visits"" with his real self made it all worthwhile.

I still weep for him. For the mental, emotional and physical pain that wracked his mind and body. And for what the disease did to my mother.  And for my own self in missing him.

I think I've known some of your pain. For whatever it's worth, this is an offer to listen to as much of anything you may want to say.

1) You didn't get his medical records. You didn't get a meds list. 

2) You were counting on someone with dementia to remember a promise about money

"I unfortunately have experience with this. Nobody wants a dementia patient with violent tendencies. There are a rare few places that ""specialize"" in difficult/violent/reluctant patients. You may want to call a few caregiver hotlines/support lines, they will give you good info. I called Care2Caregivers (not sure if that's available where you are) and they gave me a few leads to pursue. Ultimately we decided to give it another 6 months at home to re-assess. 

Yes, a psychiatric hold is an option if the patient is violent/endangering themself or others. You want to avoid this if possible, because it means they'll be transported to the ER. If you're lucky, there will be an open bed at a nearby geriatric psych unit; if you live in an area with limited resources, there may be nowhere for them to go, and they will be kept in the ER (very confusing, not particularly safe). Transfer to a geriatric psych unit will be confusing for him but they are definitely the best people to get his meds evaluated &amp; stable. If an ambulance is called, direct them to take him to a hospital WITH a geriatric psych unit, even if it's not the closest one. Transfer within hospital is much easier than transferring to a different hospital/system. If a 5150 is what it comes to, you can also refuse to take him back. If you are adamant that he cannot come home to you, the hospital social workers will be forced to assume responsibility for his placement. 

His private pay to Medicaid transition is not that unusual. I wouldn't worry too much about it. Find a place that takes Medicaid, and just go through the process. GET IT IN WRITING that they will allow him to transfer from private pay to Medicaid!! You are also right that he will need to be declared incompetent. A psychiatric hold may streamline that process a little more than if you have to go through the court system again. 

Keep persisting with the doctors to get crush orders, or a switch to liquid meds. If he's refusing to take meds, that's probably contributing to his fluctuations in behavior. What is he on, and how long has he been on it? It may be time to reassess and try different meds, because this regime obviously isn't working. For what it's worth, we tried several different things. What finally worked (and has been a complete game changer) is risperidone twice per day, and mirtazapine once per day. I was very reluctant to go down the anti-psychotic route, but it's made the hugest, most amazing difference. The extreme paranoia, threats, accusations, and physical abuse have stopped completely.

You are NOT the first person to go through this. I am so sorry you are, because there is a huge gap in memory care--- there are the sweet, confused dementia patients... And then people like our family members, who are verbally and physically absuive, and who nobody wants to care for. The good news is that the memory care unit will be MUCH more equipped to handle his outbursts than assisted living. He will not be their first patient to go through this. And, while I understand you're afraid they will kick him out in a few weeks... That gives you a few weeks, and buys you some time to research and see if the new meds are helping at all. Go through with the move, hope for the best, and have a backup plan just in case. It will probably be easiest if you guys just quietly move him in, without fanfare or explanation. If he is agitated by the move, white lie!!  Say that there was a flood in the other part of the building, and this is his newer/nicer room. No need to rationalize or try to explain. 

Edit: also wanted to say... Memory care units have seen worse than a cup of coffee thrown at someone! My family member is at home, but has threatened with knives, hit people in the head with frying pans and flower vases, given black eyes, twisted arms, pinched &amp; hit. It would be unusual for a dementia patient to never have a moment of belligerence, honestly. Your biggest hurdles right now are getting him into the new unit (again, lie! Like a rug!), and then the nurses need to focus on getting meds into him. This is not an impossible situation, though I know it feels like it.

While hospice is an option, apparently Medicare has gotten stricter.

Reading between the lines it sounds like they were afraid of not getting reimbursed if he came off a second time. As his condition deteriorated he was eventually accepted, and died on hospice.

Ask the doctor about palliative care. Like hospice the goal is comfort, not cure, but is more open-ended. My father was put on palliative care when he was rejected for hospice.

He knows my mom, knows me, knows a lot of his past, but cant remember anything from 5 minutes ago or a day ago, constantly pacing, constantly talking to himself etc.

The problem is he wanted my mom to be his caregiver for years for a few reasons, he knew she'd get paid by the state and he'd live in a comfortable area where he felt safe.

But something happened and something went wrong, the VA started to say he was insane and they gave him another ""caregiver"" (that's not the word, i just cant remember the actual name for it at the moment). And we had to fight for, i guess...custody over him lol.

After finally getting it, we got his stuff from the hospital, moved him here, and he was happy. then about a month and a half ago he just started acting different.

The VA refuses to give us any money, only enough money to eat for a day or 2, and we get that money once a month. And she hasn't gotten paid. So lawyers are involved and stuff.

Now we decided we want him to live in a home because it's not fair to us to be getting screwed by the state. And the person that was his conservater or whatever, was not a nice person.

"Yes...Up until Feb of this year, my mom was what we thought in  late stage 5 to early stage six. Up until that time she had been slowly loosing her speech and basically going through most of the effects of the disease. Then in March she started to rapidly decline. She could only say a word here and there, did not want to eat or drink, and started having a hard time standing and walking. We (my sisters and me) did not realize it at the time but mom had entered the stage that I call the Beginning of the End. By the time May got here mom was so weak we took her to see her doctor, hoping the doctor would give her intravenous fluids to ward off dehydration. To our surprise the doctor told us that mom had reached the end stage of the disease and it was time to call in hospice. The doctor estimated mom had 2 weeks to 2 months to live. Mom died on June 15th, 2016, 2 weeks from the time hospice can in . I was in shock for a few weeks because mom had only been diagnosed 4 years ago and I thought we would be dealing this this disgusting disease for a few more years. Today, however, I can say that as much as I miss my mom, I'm thankful she did not suffer as long as I have seen others suffer. She still knew me and my sisters, and she was only incontinent for one day. These were two of the things she dreaded the most. My mom was ready to go.

I shared my story with you because rapid decline can mean that the end is not to far away. Luckily my mom never had a fall or accident, but for four year, I read everything I could get my hands on about dementia/Alzheimer's and from what I learned, an accident or illness can bring on a rapid decline. Take it one day at a time, and try not to get to stressed out about what tomorrow will bring. Best of luck to you and your family.

Try your local 2-1-1 line for information (literally pick up the phone and dial 2-1-1 and tell the operator you're looking for elder-care information).

My dad had savings, Medicare and we knew he was going to need to be on Medicaid before a year or two were out--when he ran out of his own funds to pay for care centers.  They put us in touch with [A Place for Mom](http://www.aplaceformom.com), which is a service that will ask you what kind of care your grandma needs (in-home, hospice, assisted living, memory care, day care, etc) and what your budget realities are, and then you can work with your state for Medicaid assistance.

Medicaid is a sort of public insurance for people without financial resources.  Elder care facilities generally get paid one of three ways:  private pay (the person or their family pays for their care directly), or from Medicaid (where the state pays), or a combination of the two where a person pays privately until they are out of funds and then gets qualified for Medicaid.

"do you or nearby friends/family have a dog or cat that could come visit? pets are great for dementia patients, can help keep them happy and occupied for a long time, even after the dog leaves and they forget he was ever there. they wont loose interest in a living pet like they will with a movie and the interaction can be benificial beyond the time they spent with the pet. have a read here maybe: http://www.alzheimers.net/2013-05-17/how-can-pets-benefit-alzheimers-patients/",,,,pll1234,,,1470536926,t5_2rfqf,t3_4r7jxn,t3_4r7jxn,1,1473263816,0,0,d67d22y,dementia,1,,
"Here's the one I've been looking at -- founded and run by a Brit and his Thai wife. There's another one run someone else that's Swiss/German (we don't speak German so that one's out).
