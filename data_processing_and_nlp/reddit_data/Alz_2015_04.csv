"Similar circumstance, in Canada.  Sold my small business in Canada to help out my Mom, figuring my brother and sister would pour in equal amounts of time to help.   Nope, absolutely everyone has abandoned her.  Sister comes by once every week or two, and unless I show up, she is basically alone, going crazier by the moment.   So it's been a few years, all my money has run out, I work pt when I can, and have had to move into a very low rent living arrangement to make things even kind of work.  The great news is, by cutting out all of the the mom's sugar intake, exercising her several times a day and adhering to a strict diet, mom, has shown some remarkable improvement.  Only thing is, the family and most of the health care workers, refuses to accept that sugar is bad for her.  IE thinks I am a complete tyrant/idiot for not letting her have pie, cookies, muffins, cakes and bread.  

They are not around enough to see the difference, don't seem to care enough and feed her sugary treats against my requests, simply to appease her, when they are around.   I have been singled out as the assh$%^.  They don't see the correlation, or the results of their sugary rewards.  Won't do any research, read any educational material or even watch any videos on the topic. 

Sister and brother control the purse strings and any money that I happen to receive is being deducted from whatever meager inheritance we will receive.  I asked for them to chip in on a decent video camera, to help document mom's behaviour and progress, to which their response was to stop talking to me. 

We seem to have less and less to do with any of the family every few months, and they talk among themselves, pointing me out as simply causing problems and making issues out of every little thing.   I give up, everyone in the family hates me now, and I am simply trying to help and do what is best for mom.  The only consolation is mom is getting a little better everyday.  However she is 80 years old, so what I see happening, is mom enjoys a few more years, that I will help to make as good as possible. Unfortunately after she passes away I will probably be estranged from the family, and not have much more contact with them.  This makes me sad, but I cannot give up on mom, for any reason, she would do it for anyone of her kids, and only one kid is willing to do the same in return.

"Neither neurofibrillary tau tangles nor amyloid (either oligomers or plaques) are the cause of Alzheimer's disease.  Nitrated tau which can become tangles interferes with neurotransmissions and the transport of nutrients.  These problems may be increased with tangles, but one can have Alzheimer's disease without the tangles.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15079014

Amyloid oligomers increase hydrogen peroxide production and this too can damage neurons, but the death of neurons in Alzheimer's disease does not require oligomers either (the plaques may actually reduce oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease by absorbing zinc and copper ions).

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16141213

http://www.sciencedebate.com/science-blog/alzheimer-s-disease-without-amyloid-plaques

Peroxynitrites--a potent oxidant--is likely the principal cause of Alzheimer's disease.  Peroxynitrites not only contribute to the formation of amyloid oligomers and plaques and nitrated tau and tau tangles, they inhibit the synthesis and release of neurotransmitters involved in short-term memory, sleep, mood, social recognition, and alertness, restrict blood flow and the transport of glucose in the brain which can lead to apathy, wandering, and delusions, prevent the regeneration of neurons in the hippocampus, and lead to the death of neurons.

The best peroxynitrite scavengers such as syringic acid and ferulic acid in Korean red (panax) ginseng and eugenol in rosemary essential oil have already partially reversed Alzheimer's disease in human clinical trials.

"Many, many more than 2 studies claim this.  Historically There have been two camps in Alzheimer's research. Those who focus on amyloid beta and believe it to be the preeminent pathogenic agent, and those who focus on tau.

The general consensus in the field more recently however, is that both are important in different ways. amyloid beta aggregation and toxicity is believed to be an early event, which triggers downstream processes such as tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation. Tau misregulation is thought to be the more direct cause of axon loss and neuronal death, which leads to the end stage Alzheimer's disease. 

That being said, many studies have shown the ability of amyloid beta to be directly toxic to neurons and to impair the cellular process of memory called Long Term potentiation.
