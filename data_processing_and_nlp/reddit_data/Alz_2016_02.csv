"there are many avenues currently being tested. Reduction of tau tangles, reduction of amyloid plaques, clearance of amyloid oligomers, reduction of neuroinflammation, just to name a few. Thousands of research groups around the world are currently trying to find a treatment. There are many that are promising in mice, but getting them to translate to humans has been very difficult so far. we will find a drug/ combination of drugs that works though, I promise you that.

I really, truly, hate to be the bearer of bad news, but as someone who has gone through what you're experiencing I feel you deserve to know the truth. 

The main reason most scientists think Alzheimer's drugs arent working in people is that we're treating them too late. By the time Alzheimer's is diagnosed, the person has already had the disease developing in them for decades. Literally decades. Once you start having noticeable memory loss, it is because of loss of brain cells. Once those cells die, we cant bring them back. Other researchers are working on ways to restore brain cells, for treatment of spinal cord injury, for instance. But these drugs may help in late stage Alzheimers as well.

However, and this is the part it really pains me to type. At your grandmothers current stage of disease, in todays current state of treatment, there is nothing that can be done. I lost my grandfather to Alzheimer's disease, and by the end he didnt even know who I was. I know your pain, and Im terribly sorry.

"Let me tell you my story"". My dad met a lovely lady when his dementia was moderate but not crippling.  Though he continued to degrade, she supported him a lot and it was hard to tell how bad he'd become.  She went into the hospital and was there for about a week before she died.  We took him to visit her daily, but he'd forget.  The day she died was a nightmare.  I told him and he collapsed with grief.  I held him while he cried and he slowly recovered, then looked at me and said,""Something awful has happened but I can't remember what it is.""  This repeated throughout the day.  It was a nightmare.  The next day, I quietly removed all the reminders of her and redirected him every time he brought up feeling sad, or where she was or anything that could even lead to discussions about her.

"There is not really much use in engaging in this type of argument.  Scientists tell me there is no evidence that Alzheimer's disease can be treated.  When I present a series of clinical trials and case studies, they usually back down a slight bit and say the evidence is inconclusive or that it proves nothing.  However, when the same types of compounds produce the same type of results time and time again than it is more than fair to say that there are effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease is currently a fatal disease.   It affects much more than memory; it affects many activities of daily living and is sometimes accompanied by severe neuropsychiatric problems.  The current medications may temporarily improve symptoms or activities of daily living but they do not change the course of the disease.

Any medication including natural products has side effects.  Each person has to make their own risk/benefit analysis.   In most but not all cases, the natural products that improved behavior (calmness, few or no delusion, less agitation) and some aspects of cognition (place memory, object memory, repetitive memory) produced greater benefits than harm (some of the more stimulating essential oils can raise blood pressure or increase anxiety).

All the links were evidence.  If you don't like the evidence (and there are legitimate reasons for questioning some of it) than that is up to you.  But I urge all the people who spit out vitriolic comments to calm down a bit and study the science of this disease as I have done for the past twelve years.  There is a path forward to the effective treatment of this disease, but only if you are pointed in the right direction.

Let's try this a different way.  Several essential oils contain the compound eugenol--a methoxyphenol--such as rosemary, lemon balm, clove, bay laurel, nutmeg, and holy basil.  Eugenol is a peroxynitrite scavenger and it inhibits the pathway that leads to peroxynitrite formation (which includes the activation of NMDA receptors and the subsequent influx of calcium).  So I am just going to string a series of titles and excerpts together to try to prove a point:

Effect of aromatherapy on patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Jimbo D1, Kimura Y, Taniguchi M, Inoue M, Urakami K.

RESULTS:
All patients showed significant improvement in personal orientation related to cognitive function on both the GBSS-J and TDAS after therapy. In particular, patients with AD showed significant improvement in total TDAS scores. Result of routine laboratory tests showed no significant changes, suggesting that there were no side-effects associated with the use of aromatherapy. Results from Zarit's score showed no significant changes, suggesting that caregivers had no effect on the improved patient scores seen in the other tests.
CONCLUSIONS:
In conclusion, we found aromatherapy an efficacious non-pharmacological therapy for dementia. Aromatherapy may have some potential for improving cognitive function, especially in AD patients.

Two of the essential oils used in this study contained methoxyphenols (eugenol in rosemary esential oil and geraniol in lemon essential oil).

The same can be done with the methoxyphenols ferulic acid and syringic acid in heat processed ginseng and Korean red ginseng;

Abstract
To ascertain the principal active peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) scavenging components of heat-processed Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer (sun ginseng [SG]), the ONOO(-) scavenging activities of fractions and components of SG were compared. The results demonstrated that the ONOO(-) scavenging ability of SG was due to its ether fraction containing phenolic compounds. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis and ONOO(-) scavenging activity tests of the phenolic acids contained in SG identified vanillic acid, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, syringic acid, and maltol as the main active ONOO(-) scavenging components of SG. The ONOO(-) scavenging activities of phenolic acids and maltol were dependent on the degrees of their proton donating ability.

Heat-processed ginseng enhances the cognitive function in patients with moderately severe Alzheimer's disease.
Heo JH, Lee ST, Chu K, Oh MJ, Park HJ, Shim JY, Kim M.
Abstract
OBJECTIVES:
Ginseng has been reported to improve cognitive function in animals and in healthy and cognitively impaired individuals. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of a heat-processed form of ginseng that contains more potent ginsenosides than raw ginseng in the treatment of cognitive impairment in patients with moderately severe Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS:
Forty patients with AD were randomized into one of three different dose groups or the control group as follows: 1.5 g/day (n = 10), 3 g/day (n = 10), and 4.5 g/day (n = 10) groups, or control (n = 10). The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were used to assess cognitive function for 24 weeks.
RESULTS:
The treatment groups showed significant improvement on the MMSE and ADAS. Patients with higher dose group (4.5 g/day) showed improvements in ADAS cognitive, ADAS non-cognitive, and MMSE score as early as at 12 weeks, which sustained for 24-week follow-up.
DISCUSSION:
These results demonstrate the potential efficacy of a heat-processed form of ginseng on cognitive function and behavioral symptoms in patients with moderately severe AD.

Improvement of Cognitive Deficit in Alzheimer’s Disease Patients by Long Term Treatment with Korean Red Ginseng
Jae-Hyeok Heo,1 Soon-Tae Lee,2,3 Min Jung Oh,2,3 Hyun-Jung Park,2,3 Ji-Young Shim,2,3 Kon Chu,2,3 and Manho Kim2,3,*

A 24-week randomized open-label study with Korean red ginseng (KRG) showed cognitive benefits in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. To further determine long-term effect of KRG, the subjects were recruited to be followed up to 2 yr. Cognitive function was evaluated every 12 wk using the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) and the Korean version of the Mini Mental Status Examination (K-MMSE) with the maintaining dose of 4.5 g or 9.0 g KRG per d. At 24 wk, there had been a significant improvement in KRG-treated groups. In the long-term evaluation of the efficacy of KRG after 24 wk, the improved MMSE score remained without significant decline at the 48th and 96th wk. ADAS-cog showed similar findings. Maximum improvement was found around week 24. In conclusion, the effect of KRG on cognitive functions was sustained for 2 yr follow-up, indicating feasible efficacies of long-term follow-up for Alzheimer’s disease.

My brother and I had already interviewed people at a coffee shop. 
She took to it better than I thought. She hired onr woman she clocked with and now they are buddies. It's so important to have companionship when they are at that stage.

Based on my experience I would have to say your MIL knows there is something wrong with her and is most likely trying to ignore it and hope it goes away. My mother also took anti-depressants and I honestly think the medication is what triggered the Alzheimer's, but I digress.
If I were you I would plan a whole day with her and incorporate the doctors visit into the day. Go for breakfast, maybe a nice long walk , shopping or something you know she will enjoy. Obviously tell her in advance that you are going to the doctor, but try to bring more attention to the other things you are going to do with her.
If your MIL indeed has a form of dementia this is going to be a very long and hard road for all of you and it is best that she feel like she trusts you. This is really hard for the person with Alzheimer's and it is very important to ease them into things and you must do everything with respect no matter how childish they may act. 
My mother passed away a week ago today so that was 7 years with the disease. Just remember to be kind and patient to your MIL and whatever you do try to not show your frustration with her, that is one of my biggest regrets with my mom.

"tl;dr warning! :-)

You should speak with a physician or a genetic counselor, and among other things, they will ask you about your family history. If DNA testing then seems warranted for medical reasons, you should take a clinically validated test ordered by a physician. For examples of such tests, head to [GeneTests.org](https://www.genetests.org).

Direct-to-consumer testing of the $99/$199 variety is currently based on genotyping (not DNA sequencing). Some of the DNA variants associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's are tested by some of these companies, but not all by any means.

[Promethease](http://snpedia.com/index.php/Promethease) is not a testing service; it is a literature reporting service that makes a report for you based on whatever data you bring to it from the testing company you used. Promethease is based on [SNPedia](http://snpedia.com/index.php/SNPedia), which is a wiki like Wikipedia but 100% focused on DNA.

So if the medical literature is accurately summarized in SNPedia, Promethease will accurately report it for the variants that were tested by the company you chose to produce the raw data. If that company didn't test a given variant, then you won't have data for it, and Promethease won't report anything about it in your report. 

There are many pages in SNPedia about DNA variants that have been reported to change Alzheimer's risk; for an overview page, see [this one](http://snpedia.com/index.php/Alzheimer%27s_disease) and feel free to click the ""What links here"" link near the bottom for a much longer list. Most variants indicate which DNA chip (aka platform) tests it, so you can see which company tests it.

Be aware of three additional factors. 

First: many disorders (including Alzheimer's) are due to both genetics and environmental factors. DNA is rarely destiny; see [Heritability](http://snpedia.com/index.php/Heritability) in SNPedia to learn more.

Second, the major genotyping (direct-to-consumer) tests have quite high technical accuracy, but they are not perfect and errors can happen, so if you get a medically significant finding you should ""get a second opinion"", i.e. you should get a clinically validated test to see if it holds up, before you make any important medical or lifestyle actions or decisions. 

Third, the medical literature primarily reports risk based on a single variant out of context of the rest of your genome. So your Promethease report will typically show that you carry some variants that slightly increase risk for a given disorder, and, some variants that slightly decrease risk for that same disorder. With few exceptions, science has not advanced to the point where it is possible to accurately calculate your overall risk for a disorder based on the exact set of variants that you happen to be carrying, even if all your DNA was assayed. 

The important question for you will probably be, ""Am I carrying a DNA mutation that all on it's own significantly increases my risk for early- or late-onset Alzheimer's?"" In SNPedia, these variants (or alleles) will usually have a ""bad repute"" and a magnitude of ~4 or higher (on a scale of 1 to 10), and so if your Promethease report only has genotypes with, say, magnitude scores of 2 or lower, it's saying that none of those type of variants were in your data file.

Conflict of interest statement: We created and maintain SNPedia and Promethease. We do our best to avoid biases and to make both as useful to as many people as possible at either no or nominal cost, but genomics is complex and it doesn't come with a guarantee or warranty. If you know of peer-published scientific information about a DNA variant that meets our inclusion [criteria](http://snpedia.com/index.php/SNPedia:FAQ#Which_SNPs_are_selected_to_go_into_the_Wiki.3F_And_where_are_they_selected_from.3F) but is missing or incorrect in SNPedia, email us the details.",,,,snpedia,,,1455822158,t5_2r8fp,t3_46d95z,t3_46d95z,2,1458584010,0,0,d04u27g,Alzheimers,2,,

PART 1&amp;2 ALZHEIMER'S ON THC PILL MEDICAL MARIJUANA HELPS DEMENTIA (see youtube video)

But it is not just a series of case studies and clinical trials, it is understanding the nature of the disease itself.  All the risk factors for Alzheimer's disease increase the production of peroxynitrite, all the aspects of Alzheimer's disease are the direct or indirect result of either hydrogen peroxide (early on) or peroxynitrite (throughout the disease), and all the compounds that have effectively treated Alzheimer's disease are peroxynitrite scavengers.  I can also tell you which antioxidants are most effective at preventing peroxynitrite formation, scavenging peroxynitrite, and reversing the damage caused by peroxynitrite and why.

Here is my favorite anonymous quote about the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

[Clinical trials with over-the-counter supplements have concentrated either on items which suppress inflammation, or on antioxidants which scavenge oxygen derived free radicals. Most of these items have proved to be worthless in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Similarly most drugs used to treat Alzheimer's
disease do little to slow the deterioration, but instead offer a mild temporary symptom relief. However, evidence has been accumulating that the primary driver of Alzheimer's disease is a nitrogen derived free radical called peroxynitrite, which may mediate both amyloid and tau accumulation as well as their toxicity. 
Excellent results have been obtained with peroxynitrite scavengers, with reversals of Alzheimer's disease in human clinical trials being repeatedly demonstrated. IMHO, the only thing which may be  preventing the abolition of Alzheimer's disease is the mental inertia of scientists, as well as the bureaucrats who fund them. Unfortunately, most bureaucrats keep throwing money 
into repeatedly testing discredited interventions, while ignoring successful ones. Common sense is anything but...]

Evidence for effectiveness does not require absolute proof or phase three clinical trials, it requires cases where people have been helped by a particular treatment.  A person like myself who presents that evidence is not a scam artist or a purveyor of false hope.  But a person who tries to deny this evidence or demean it, is an obstacle to further studies that may lead to a higher level or proof.

"Depending on your future mother-in-laws age, would depend on early onset or just Dementia/ALZ. If she is 65 or older that is considered Dementia/Alz. If as she is younger than 65 it would considered early onset. 

Anyway, I agree with you 100%. She is showing signs of Dementia. Actually, to a pretty high degree. She badly needs to see her General Practitioner to start with, then her GP will make recommendations from there. 

As a new in-law this can put you in a awkward situation. The immediately family (husband, children) need to get involved. Your future mother-in-law can be in denial, for whatever reason, or just unaware because of the dementia, and that can put the family in a situation of forcing or tricking her to go see the doctor. Either way can be a very unpleasant experience for everyone involved. But, no matter what it takes, they need to get her to her doctors before she gets hurt.

My suggestion would is to talk to your fiancé. If your fiancé has brothers, or sisters, they should talk and get involved. If not, and your fiancé is the only child, then it would be up to you and your fiancé. But your fiancé need to be on board.

"Very interesting question. I've been on a journey for the past three years to understand dementia and Alzheimer's. It has been very difficult to get definitive, unbiased, non PC answers to so many of issues facing people with Alz., as well as, family's dealing with dementia. It's been like running through a never ending maze.  

From what I have learned, I will give it a go at your questions.

&gt;Do you think people with AD really understand their deficit? 

For most people in the earlier stages, they do have a limited understanding of their deficit. The exception to this would be doctors or people that have been exposed to Alz. through work or family. These people, in the earlier stages, would have a very good understanding of their deficit, but even with this understanding, they would not be able to control their deficits (symptoms). Once the disease progresses, everyone eventually loses their ability to understand their deficits and much more. Some quicker than others. It just depends on the person.

&gt;Do family and friends understand what it's like? 

If you mean do family and friends understand what it's like to have Alz. then the answer would be a resounding NO. But, there are a lot of very knowledgeable people like Teepa Snow who is an occupational therapist, that has an excellent clinical understanding of Alz. She has made many dementia caregiver training videos. I believe the key to caring for someone with Alz. is a lot of love, a lot of patients, very thick skin, and to educated yourself as much as possible. Also, learn to live in their world. Don't expect or try to get them to live in your world. Even if you are able to pull all this off, you will still make hundreds of mistakes. 

&gt;Do they empathies and try to adjust to the problems people with AD have or just get frustrated and shy away? 

Without a doubt, most get frustrated and shy away or just disappear. Though I think in most cases it's not that people don't empathize, they just do not understand, and that's scary for most people. Through my experience with my mother that has Alz. and talking to many others that care for family with Alz. this is  extremely common everywhere. Most of the time, other than a couple close family members, and if lucky maybe a friend or two, everyone else just fades away. 

&gt;what kind of awareness or education does the public need about AD? 

**As much as possible.** In approximately 20 years 1 out of every 2 people over the ages of 80 to 85 will have some type of progressive dementia. Most will have Alz. This is one half of all people over the ages of 80 to 85. This will be that global pandemic that we have all been warned about for many years.

The only bright side to all this is, there are thousands of scientist, and companies looking for therapies to treat dementia. Some of the leading scientist working in this field seem to think in about 20 year time there should be effect drugs and therapies available to drastically slow down the progression of the disease with early detection.

"I know as much or maybe even more about Alz. than you, because I live it everyday. I am very much aware that the current drugs available to treat Alz. do very little for a very short period of time, and for some people, nothing at all to actually treat the disease or symptoms. But your holistic type approach to treating Alz. will never result in more than just treating SOME of the symptoms in SOME of the people with Alz. All the while the disease is progressing and not slowing any. That's exactly what prescribed Alz. drugs do now. So what have you accomplished? If some people want to use your products to deal with some of the side effects of this disease, and it works for them, great. But that is the most your products/claims/studies will ever amount to. I believe you know this, but you are trying to sell your products. 

&gt;There is a path forward to the effective treatment of this disease, but only if you are pointed in the right direction. 

Yes there is. Scientist that I have spoken with are very pleased with the amount of progress being made towards real effective drugs and therapies that will actually work to treat Alz. They are on the right path. They are headed in the right direction. Most scientist are confident that in about 20 years time, there will be drugs and therapies, that when started early in the disease, will slow the disease to a virtual crawl. The person with the disease will have a better chance of dying from other causes than Alz. Progress is being made at a very rapid pace, albeit not soon enough for those of us dealing with this devastating disease now.

&gt;Evidence for effectiveness does not require absolute proof or phase three clinical trials, it requires cases where people have been helped by a particular treatment.

I'm still floored that you would make this statement, because the only evidence you have provided were obscurer abstracts from clinical trials. You have yet to show the evidence from people that have been helped by a particular product. Where is the evidence???????

If you want to make the claim that your natural products can, *in some cases*, help ease the symptoms of Alz., then that might be a fair claim. But to claim that your approach/products will treat Alz., and if started in the early stages, your products can actually slow down the progression of this disease and improve cognition and function is **deceiving, and thus, you are a purveyor of false hope.** No one, with sufficient critical thinking an understand of this disease, is going to buy into your claims that your products are going to be or even become a legitimate treatment for Alz. You should be ashamed of yourself for preying on people who are despite for anything that will help their loved one's. Just to line your own pockets. You remind me of the quacks in the traveling medical shows in the 1800's with sales pitches peddling miracle cures, elixirs and other various products of a dubious nature. And you've been doing this for twelve years............

"To add to this, Alzheimer's disease is a disease of oxidation and nitration.  Oxidants inhibit the synthesis and release of neurotransmitters involved in short-term memory, sleep, mood, social recognition and alertness, they inhibit neurotransmissions by preventing the dephosphorylation of tau proteins,  they limit blood flow and the transport of glucose in the brain which can lead to delusions and wandering, they prevent the regeneration of neurons in the hippocampus, and they kill neurons.

A Mediterranean diet is high in polyphenols which act as antioxidants.  Such a diet reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease and by partially reversing oxidation and nitration, slows the progression of the disease.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3024594/

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2673956/

I suppose this is one thing that I would like people to know about Alzheimer's disease: it is a treatable disease.  It does not matter how many tau tangles or how much amyloid a person has in his or her brain, as long as oxidants are being scavenged, the person does not develop Alzheimer's disease.  On the other hand, a person with almost no amyloid or tau tangles in his or her brain can still develop Alzheimer's disease due to the exhaustion of internal antioxidants.

The most powerful antioxidants such as eugenol in various essential oils via aromatherapy and syringic acid and ferulic acid in panax ginseng will partially reverse Alzheimer's disease.

"Hello :). We are learning a ton lately on Alzheimer's disease, and the modifiable risk factors associated with it.  Your apoe genotype dictates when your brain starts to accumulate amyloid but taking action before then can make a very significant difference in disease later on.  We know that, aside from genes, concussion, poor sleep, early menopause without estrogen replacement, hypertension, stroke, smoking, midlife obesity, depression, and low education increase risk by at least 50%.  Following a strict Mediterranean diet and daily vigorous exercise, constant learning, (evidence building for mindfulness meditation) lower risk by at least 50%.  African Americans have more than double the rate of AD than whites.  But apoe frequency is the same! That means that lifestyle, food habits, health status accounts for 100% of the higher incidence.

"So sorry......She has a terrible ""bed side manner!"" Your right, some the questions they *have* to ask can be uncomfortable and upsetting to some patients as well as family. But when a patient's cognitive functions are assessed properly, in a warm, caring, understanding way, it can make for a lot less stress. A little stress is normal, because for a proper assessment, the patient has to answer all the questions, not you, and when you want to protect someone you love, that can be difficult.

Like you, I would be very upset if a doctor chastised me about anything, especially if I was taking care of a loved one with ALZ and doing the best I could do......that's just wrong! Her behavior was totally unacceptable. I'd have a major problem with her also.

My mom has ALZ. She was diagnosed 3 years ago. She has only seen her neurologist twice for two brain scans and cognitive assessments about a year apart, when she was first diagnosed. Now she only sees her PCP every three months, and she assesses mom's current situation and prescribes whatever she needs. Of course, I don't know what the future holds, but unless her PCP orders another brain image, she's not seeing a neurologist.

I have been researching ALZ and Dementia for three years and have talked to many, many caregivers and family members about their experiences, and in all this time, **everyone's** experience getting someone diagnosed and receiving continual care has been different. Even in the same City. As a result, I am lead me to believe that there are no protocol's in place for the diagnostic process and continual care for Dementia patient's. It is totally left up to the PCP and/or neurologist (and sometimes a Physiatrist also) to determine diagnosis and treatment. 

If I were in your situation (and this is just me), I would share with my moms PCP everything you just shared with me. Your wife's PCP and neurologist may not be on the same page, or the PCP may feel more comfortable if you wife sees a neurologist once a year and is prescribed certain drugs by a neurologist??? There could be a number of different reasons your wife is seeing both doctors. The doctors alone are making all the calls (which makes me a little uncomfortable). However, HIPPA laws are in place for a reason. Among other patient rights, they give you and your wife the right to work with her doctors, and decide what course of treatment **you** feel is best, and you do not have to put up with unacceptable behavior.

Good luck to you and your wife!

1. My mom doesn't understand her deficits, but she knows and feels very confused most of the time.
2. I don't think most family members have even a baseline understanding of AD when the process begins. and some never get it.
3. It's hard to spend time with someone with AD as the illness progresses. Listening to the same 3 sentences over and over is tiresome. Listening to the rants, being berated, etc etc is hard too. and then there's the moment in time when I'm no longer remembered (long past the time of being loved by my mom) and then it becomes easier to stay away because 'I' am busy and she doesn't know me and she doesn't care if I come.
