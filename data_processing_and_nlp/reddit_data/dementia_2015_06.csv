Are there relative with whom she can live, aunts, uncles, siblings, cousins? Our situation (mother diagnosed with vascular dementia) is that she doesn't require constant supervision and is fine around the house on her own. Still, I've moved back in to take care of her and we have a care provider who comes twice per week. This works well for us in that she's living in the family home of 40+ years. Depending upon the severity and the living circumstances, a care provider might be an option. Moving our mom into a care facility was definitely an option we didn't want to resort to since that pretty much would have meant that she'd never return home.

"Hello, sorry to hear about your mom's behaviour.  In regards to claiming she's been doing things that you have done yourself, my mom (who has been diagnosed with Alzhiemers) does this a lot, for example claiming that she had gone to the shops to buy the present that I had just got round.  I do the 'love lies' thing of just agreeing with her as there's no point in having an argument.  I guess it's just the way of 'filling in the blanks' of how a new object they don't remember got into their lives.

In regard to the next step, they'll probably need an MRI scan or ruling out water infections to give the diagnosis of dementia.   For how this may affect your life, it may not necessarily mean giving up your job, it could be that a solution may be a carer visiting twice a day to check on her and to make sure pills are taken, and panic buttons installed for emergencies.  Depending where you are the costs might be met by health insurance etc.

"We had this issue. He only qualified for 20 hours a week and she qualified for 40. She went into the hospital and her person wasn't there, so we had to take off and care for him. The insurance company had to reevaluate his condition before approving more time, which he should have been getting to begin with, but the process was slow. We ended up having to use his short term respite stay when our vacation time ran out. Which worked out as she was unable to return home and ended up discharging to the care home we chose for him. 

Once their initial eval and assessment is done, it takes forever to get a reassessment. 

FYI, if he was ever deployed to a combat zone, he likely qualifies for VA aid and attendance. It is a cash benefit that can help pay for a private caregiver if his insurance company won't approve more time. It takes a while to get, but it helped us tremendously.
