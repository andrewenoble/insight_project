"Plate size won't cure the compulsion to jam too much food in her mouth. We have these little desert plates that I use at lunch. They are maybe 6 inches and I sue them because they perfectly fit a sandwich and a small handful of chips or fruit. It didn't matter what type of plate we used. She would still try to stuff her mouth and it was a major choking hazard because she has dysphagia. Portioning out food was the only thing that worked. Eventually her condition progressed where she was no longer able to self feed so I am very easily able to control how much she gets into her mouth, but before we got to this point it was a major battle for a little while to keep her from choking on things. The issue now is she still wants to put things into her mouth which these days is basically just her blanket.

"Oh! This explains so much!

The first thing that you need to understand is that your grandfather is not in his right mind. This is so difficult, because dementia patients can be quite adamant and determined. You must step back and separate yourself from the emotional aspect of being his grandchild, and look at his behavior objectively.

My own FIL was once a successful businessman. As he descended into dementia, he receded into a an angry state where he accused my husband's mother of ruining him and destroying his millions. Of course, the truth was that he squandered away his money, and treated everyone terribly, in-general.

You have to wrap your head around the fact that your grandfather is operating in another reality. In his mind, everything he believes is the absolute truth. You must approach this as you would a five-year-old who insists that they have to eat a cupcake for dinner.  Of course, they want that. Of course, they insist that is reality. But, they no longer have agency.

It's especially difficult for you; because you have to help your mother through the pain of losing her father while he is still alive. She is facing the challenge of a former authority (who still looks and talks like her father), yet who can no longer make rational decisions. In essence, you may need to be the rational mind for both your grandfather and your mother. Try to empathize by imagining how hard it would be if your mother suddenly began acting like a small child.

Of course, you want to give your mother the opportunity to stand up to him and take control. She should arrange guardianship and oversee every aspect of his care. At the point that you describe, he is too far gone to manage his own care.

The fact that he vomits could be your out. Wait until he does this, with your mother away, and call emergency services. Explain to them that he has dementia and that you fear for his life. The key is to get him into managed care.

Now, keep in mind that he will quickly lose his fortune, once this takes place. If your mother is invested in her inheritance, she should have the opportunity to take over his money and make sure that he has caretakers. If, at any point, he is neglected; then you should report it to elder services. 

So sorry for your situation. The good news is that you have more options than most people do. Don't forget that you are dealing with someone who is financially capable of receiving adequate care. There is absolutely **NO** reason that you should have to be his caretaker!",,,,whatsreallygoingon,,,1467341335,t5_2rfqf,t3_4qltih,t1_d4uue0n,2,1471072828,0,0,d4uv7x7,dementia,2,,

"""TauRx’s tau aggregation inhibitors (TAIs) are the product of nearly 30 years of research, preclinical and clinical investigations. The company’s first-generation TAI, rember®, is a patented, highly-purified version of methylene blue, a compound previously used to treat a variety of conditions.

The TauRx team reported encouraging Phase 2 clinical trial results with rember®, providing strong support for the tau hypothesis and adding to the well-established correlations confirmed by many groups linking the spread of tau aggregation pathology with clinical dementia from its earliest detectable stages. The findings suggested that a treatment targeting the tau aggregation cascade could potentially delay the progression of cognitive decline in mild to moderate Alzheimer’s.

TauRx is now confirming these findings in Phase 3 clinical trials with the company's second-generation TAI, LMTX®. The Phase 3 clinical trial programme involves over 1,900 patients and comprises three separate trials: two in Alzheimer's disease and one in the rare neurodegenerative disorder, behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. This Phase 3 programme is now coming to a conclusion but TauRx will not be making any public comments or issuing any statements about the individual trial results until the data from the final study to complete is available for analysis. The company currently plans to make an initial announcement of the results of the first two trials to complete at two presentations at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC) in Toronto, Canada on 27th July. Until then, TauRx believes it would be scientifically inappropriate to comment on results as data analysis is still ongoing.""

"You haven't given a location; so I'll assume that you are in the U.S.

I think that the first thing you must do is discern all contributing factors to this situation. Keep in mind that I'm going to speak from my own experience, and in simplified terms.

Your grandfather is living with you for one (or a combination) of the following reasons:

**1. Cultural:** Your mom is conditioned to believe that you take care of family ""no matter what"". She comes from a place where multi-generational households are the norm; and it's cause of shame to abandon loved ones because of failing physical or mental health.

In this case, she may be blind to the fact that her children are not of the same mindset.

**2. Financial Distress:** Your grandfather may be destitute, and your mother believes that there is no way to pay for his professional care.

**3. Financial Greed:** Your grandfather may have money, that your mother is utilizing, and she understands how quickly it will vanish once his is being cared for, properly.

**4. Ignorance:** Your mother has no knowledge (or inclination to learn) of the services available for your grandfather.

Once you figure out which one applies, you can be better equipped to act.

The most important thing to remember is that your grandfather had the opportunity to live his life. At some point, he was able to think about, and plan for, his future. Had he done this, adequately, he would be taken care of. Since that is not the case, you should not be expected to sacrifice your youth in payment for his misfortune. The gift of palliative care should only be a ""gift"" and not a burden. And, since it is of your mother's choosing, it should be her gift (not yours). 

The Medicaid system is set up to provide complete care for the indigent. If your grandfather is indigent, then you just need a dementia diagnosis, and an assessment that he is unable to care for himself, to begin the placement process. This is expedited by a medical emergency. In our case, my FIL had a panic attack that looked like a cardiac event. Once we got him to the emergency room the system kicked in. He was diagnosed and sent to rehab, where they assessed him for long-term-care. Now, it's imperative that someone (preferably your mother and/or you) have a durable Power of Attorney or guardianship in place. Otherwise, he will be at the mercy of the state.

If the pieces are in place, then you can get him into a memory care unit. It may seem terrible; but at least you have the ability to choose where he goes. They will make sure he is fed, bathed, toileted and looked after. It may not be wonderful; but trained professionals can provide better care than you can. Plus, it's completely unfair to saddle you with this!

If this is a cultural issue, or if you mother is in some type of denial (very common with children of demented parents), then this will be much more difficult. Start by utilizing the social services and advocacy organizations at your disposal. They may be able to help your mother come to terms with why keeping him at home is not necessarily in his best interest. If she can't accept this, then you may need to make yourself unavailable by moving out or taking an extended leave of absence from your house.

The final scenario ""Financial Greed"" is much more insidious; and I hope is not the case. If your grandfather has a certain number of assets, then he does not qualify for Medicaid. This would mean that any facility he is put into would require full payment, until he is out of money. This is called ""paying down assets"". He can also pay down assets by giving your mother money for expenses while he lives with her. If there is a large inheritance, then your mother could be biding time until he dies and she gets it. Putting him into a facility would quickly eat that up.

So, what it comes down to is that your grandfather is perfectly eligible for good care, and your mother is either too ignorant or too greedy to make that happen. Instead, she is imposing upon you to buy time until there isn't a choice to be made. 

Make it your job to understand what your granfather's financial situation is, what the local social services provide (in-home care, adult daycare, palliative care, etc.) and what Medicaid options are available. The best option is to talk to a qualified elder law attorney.

Good luck to you, and please don't let your mother's decision be a detriment to your life!",,,,whatsreallygoingon,,,1467331957,t5_2rfqf,t3_4qltih,t3_4qltih,3,1471070200,0,0,d4upn38,dementia,3,,
"How about getting her an evaluation for speech-language therapy? Seeing that your mother is in the early stages, she can participate and make functional gains. In the sessions, they may target identifying activities at her level to increase participation; establishing a memory book to supplement memory; promote sustained attention for engagement of activities; and work on orientation to environment and situation. I work with dementia and Alzheimer's patients daily at a skilled nursing home, but usually they aren't the best rehab candidates. I wish I could treat more patients at her level. As her diseases progresses, she will likely be referred for a speech consult for dysphagia (swallowing disorder). People with dementia show signs of leaving food in their mouth and other poor swallowing problems that place them at risk for other serious medical problems, like aspiration pneumonia.

"The thing to do in this stage, where things have changed, but he can't remember those changes, is to fib a bit... 

Reminding him that those things are no longer his doesn't help, since he's no longer capable of remembering  what you tell him.

Therefore, each time you tell him his house is gone, his cars are gone, he's literally hearing it for the first time. And the pain he feels is the pain of learning *just now* that he no longer has a home or cars.

Instead, how you can help him is to give him some reason for those things not being around that sounds temporary, such as the cars are in the shop because they needed a tune-up, or he's staying with you because the house is getting a new roof.

You don't have to worry that later he'll be asking you why it's taking so long to tune up the cars, because he won't remember you told him that any more than he now remembers you telling him that they've been sold.

So each time you tell him they're getting a tune-up, he'll be hearing it for the first time.

A lot of people are uncomfortable with the idea of lying to somebody they respect and love. It can seem underhanded and manipulative.

"I battle with similar feelings as well. I've found that waiting until you feel capable of keeping your cool and being compassionate is a valuable move. I always regret being snippy, and even though she may not even remember THAT I was snippy, I still do and it adds to the pile of emotional stresses regardless.

I remember that her world is different from mine and it feels like a privilege to add some sort of fleeting positivity to her day, if even for a moment. 

But again, sometimes we are just not at that point, and you can't take good care of anyone while you yourself are in a bad spot.  I find nothing wrong with not being chatty.

"I've had both the blessing and curse of raising up a baby(now toddler) while caring for my grandmother with dementia. The crossover in observable behaviors is a real head trip sometimes. Both my grandmother and my son would do this, and luckily it was a relatively short lived phase for both.

When they safely finished that portion, I would portion out some more. The major downside to this was meals became an hour+ long event and I had to tailor meals to allow me to do this. It's really hard to do this with soup FYI. Things that can be cut up work great. 

As for number 2, we call it Dementia Blindness. It gets worse and you may start noticing her reach past items to grab things. Dementia not only affects cognitive functions like the executive command center and memory, it affects our brains ability to interpret stimuli like images, sound taste, even spatial perception. Our brain naturally filters out like 90% of the stuff that comes through our optic nerve. A brain melted by dementia no longer naturally provides that same filter and suddenly someone with mid to late stage dementia has major issues with identifying things visually. I've been through the spectrum with gram in terms of dementia progression. In some cases, the brain registering even half of what is coming through the optic nerve is being exceedingly generous. Gram is essential blind, though not blind in the sense that you or I understand it. She sees stuff, but she has no way of interpreting it on a regular basis. Every once in a while a piston will fire and she'll focus on my shirt, but those instances are becoming few and far between these days. Keep an eye out on that one and if you start seeing her cram non food items in her mouth, lock up items that she may mistake for food like dish detergent other cleaning products. Gram once though a sponge was a sandwich. I had to quite literally wrestle it from her. ",,,,DoctorFlimFlam,,,1469162489,t5_2rfqf,t3_4u10h7,t3_4u10h7,3,1471596850,0,0,d5lyt8d,dementia,3,,
"He visits the doctor every 6 months ago for regular blood work done. I am not sure about a CT scan though and he is not diabetic. On his bad days he generally seems anxious and nothing like himself. He really panics and gets worked up about there being any change to his normal schedule and the way he acts is unrecognisable to what he will be like the very next day.

On his good days he will be like his 50year old self chatting, going for walks, reading etc etc... It is just so strange. 

I would love for him to have a full medical whilst here in the UK as I don't really trust the doctors in India (they seem more concerned with trying to make money from his medical needs than helping us) however, unfortunately our family in no way can afford the private medical costs.

"They were both in their early 70s and deteriorated rapidly within just a couple of years. Not typical of Alzheimer's patients who can linger for on the average of ten years.

20% of women over 65 have low thyroid, yet a huge chunk of them are undiagnosed. Yes, the single thyroid test that is often given to rule out thyroid disease is much too big a crapshoot in sensitivity to rely upon. These folks are told by the AACE (endocrinology guidelines board) that the TSH is ""extremely accurate,"" when there is zero evidence to support that assertion. It has *never* been tested for sensitivity. The way in which the initial reference range was set included a pool of women who weren't excluded for thyroid disease. It's certainly not reliable enough, being a test of the pituitary output, to eliminate hypothyroidism as a possible culprit. There are other tests that are much less expensive than a round of Alzheimer's drugs. 

My mother-in-law had nearly every single low-thyroid symptom: extreme cold intolerance, joint aches, low appetite, extremely dry skin, fatigue, high cholesterol, anxiety, insomnia etc. etc. She should have been more thoroughly screened. 

It's impossible to say how many of those 45% of Alzheimer's patients who are misdiagnosed have thyroid disease, but my guess is that it is a lot. Thyroid disease is extremely inexpensive to correct, relying on drugs that are *long* out of patent. I feel that the influence that big pharma have over the AACE could be to blame (they fund every convention/seminar they have, many to vacation locales, etc.) As you know, it's much more lucrative to medicate someone for Alzheimer's.

The same might be said for B12 deficiency, which is also terribly underdiagnosed in the elderly. 

This might be worth checking out for more in depth understanding of testing problems in eliminating non-Alzheimer's causes of dementia: www.logicalneuro.com

"What brought you into the clinic specifically for this testing? Behavior/language deficits and decline in behavior/language are still the best markers for FTD.

Do you have history of alcoholism; do you have sleep apnea (or are extremely overweight); do you have depression? These can often muddy neuropsychiatric results and can even be seen on pet-scans. 

Is the clinic you went to especially known for FTD diagnoses and treatment? Although FTD is more well known than in the past, I would expect that diagnosis is still dicey. Unless the clinicians themselves have extensive experience with FTD, I would get to a clinic that does. A lot of time, they can help with costs. This is the biggest on the east coast: https://ftd.med.upenn.edu/our-center. There is a growing network of help for people and families with FTD and a number of support groups with FB pages, etc. I would focus though on just getting information.

Well, I don't think you really do. Going through this has to take some mental, physical, and emotional toll. It just has to. So you just cope as well as you can - which is all you can do. 

The necessities for me:

An intact sense of humor. When you start losing that you need help right away. That is what made me pickup the phone and call a therapist finally.  

An ability to lie. We like to call them ""fiblets"" and that's OK but sometimes you need to pull a whopper out of nowhere. 

Stay away from the booze. A little sumthin' sumthin' now and then, yes. But drinking to make it all go away is a 100% recipe for disaster. 

I have little semi hidden signs around the house. ""It's the disease stupid!"" For when my wife has really pulled something that pissed me off or made me want to cry. And I need to remind myself it's not her fault. 

A good cry now and then don't hurt nuthin. As long as you can stop.

Please make sure that you have a POA who will look after you, and make your wishes known. Also keep in mind that people with FTD usually exhibit behavior that requires specific professional care; so asking to be kept out of a facility may not be reasonable.

That being said, my experience with FTD is that the patients seem to handle it gracefully and may not suffer as much as those with Alzheimer's; although there is a tendency to act out. My FIL is still able to recall memories and have good experiences.

"Honestly, telling someone they have dementia/alzheimers is generally not a good idea. Who would react well to that? Nobody. It's an instant cause of fear, anger, and denial. It would be extremely hard to convince someone they have a memory problem. Perhaps in a lucid moment they'd realize something was wrong, but generally not. I'd stop wasting your efforts there. And honestly, ""telling her"" she has a problem and making a bet about it.... That seems very disrespectful to me. I would be offended if I was her. I understand you're doing what you can to get her evaluated, but it's important to go about it the right way.

You can report her to Adult Protective Services- this is probably your best option- they will come out to do an evaluation, and hopefully take over. If they don't or you're not willing to call, you can try writing a letter to her doctor expressing your concerns. Don't get in the car with her.

"Let me start by saying thank you to your advices. Some of the things you said I didn't know where possible (or just forgot) and were extremely helpful. 

About the diagnosis portion:
 - She has talked to dead people but rarely. Looking back, they happened when she out right refused to sleep for 48 hours and sometimes after she takes the quetiapine (she really tries to fight the urge to sleep ... it usually takes at least 3/4 hours to make her sleep with 25mg of quetiapine). But she confuses people all the time and I never contradict her, even when she can't say words I just complete her thoughts with random words like ... ""thing"", ""them"", ""him"", ""her"", etc.

About the liquid medicine. I completely forgot about it. I'll talk to her physician. 

About the mood. I almost understand her behaviour like science. I can tell when she needs to pee, I can tell when she starts getting too agitated and then starts crying non stop (usually a few hours after citalopram) so I give her plidex, a medicine with 3.5mg of diazepam. It usually calms her down but it doesn't work all the time and I am really afraid of giving her too much medicine, because I know it can worsen her condition.

About the bathroom. Probably too much information given in the original text. I just meant to say that she barely walks to and from the bathroom. Today she walked a lot more than she usually does and she did it until her legs were shaking (it's really difficult to tell when she's tired ... I said she walked a lot more but it must have added up to 1 or 2 blocks, which is not much).

About the dizziness. It started in 2002/2003 (I was 14) when all of a sudden she stood up from the couch looking like she was agonizing and she ""drunk walked"" (body pressed against a wall) until she reached the bathroom and started puking. She put her head on the sink, spread her legs and put her butt on the wall (very thin bathroom) or else she would fall. I attribute that episode to the beginning of her condition, I truly believe that this is the moment she had her first micro infartion. She went to doctors but they all said: ""you're fiiiine .. you're gonna outlive us all"" and all that ""jazz"". Some of them treated her for vertigo. She suspected it wasn't vertigo, but like all doctors, if there isn't anything showing on THEIR OWN exams, then it's nothing. She did the next MRI many years later when I forced her to and by then the damage was already done.

About making feel better. The thing about doing things she liked is that the only thing she did was work, drink some [mate](http://nobsbb.nobsbb.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Yerba-Mate-Bombilla-300x259.jpg) with her mother while watching TV and she can't watch TV anymore because she confuses reality and TV. Fortunately I always aggree with her reality and I go along with everything. Probably the only thing I was doing right. The only thing I can make her do is hug her and kiss her a lot, because it's the only way we can communicate, but it's really difficult for me, I'm not a very touchy person, I don't like being affectionate, I wasn't even affectionate as a child, but I can't complain. That's one f the few moments she feels well. What kills me are the 5 minutes she's completely lucid she says that she wants to die or asks me to kill her.

About coping. This is my first attempt at coping. I tried talking with her brother, but he's kinda closed up and the rest of the people don't really understand. As much as they may love their grandparents, when it happens to a parent or parental figure it's so much worst. When my grandmother had it I prepared myself and was able to get over it really fast, but now that it's happening to my mother I'm breaking down.

About being a carer. I am while I'm here. It kills me but I can't leave my job to take care of her and I can't take my job closer to her, so I'll have to worry whenever I'm away and stay by her side when I'm not working.

Again thank you for your help. Saying these things actually made me feel better and understand it a bit more, even though I couldn't give much information and also pardon my english. It's not rusty, I use it every day for my job, but it isn't my first language and I find it difficult to express myself sometimes.

"I used to care 24/7 for my grandma, and now I oversee her care. You should request regular time off, most importantly. I have a feeling you will soon be tired of 24/7 care without a break. I hired a caregiver for my grandmother, and she gets 1 evening (4 hours) off mid-week, and a 24 hour block each weekend, as well as 1 extra paid day off each month. You can also request time off (probably paid), to be arranged in advance- in which case they'd have to hire a sub or book her into respite. 

Make sure you get a reasonable salary, don't give a lowball salary just because you're family- I did that for over a year, and it bit me in the ass when I stopped doing her daily care, because I had very little saved up.

Guard your ""off time"" and mental health like it's a lion guarding her cub. Because it's family, they may expect you to bend the rules occasionally, but it's incredibly easy to be taken advantage of. If you ever feel like you need to walk away from the arrangement, do it and don't feel bad.

Make a plan for your medical insurance. Will they pay for it, or you? Most live-ins pay for their own.

Ask for a discretionary fund or weekly allowance for going out for movies, meals, etc. Ask for a credit card or debit card to use when purchasing groceries, clothes, etc for grandma- not a good idea to take it out of your account and get reimbursed. 

Decide who will be in charge of filling prescriptions and doing med boxes. Usually the aid does this, I happen to do my grandma's because I cover her day off every weekend.

Figure out how you'll pay your taxes- ask the lawyer about this. 

Beyond the legal and practical aspects, be prepared for a hell of a ride. I'm honestly wondering if you know what you're getting yourself into (not that anyone really does!). But it seems like your heart is in the right place, and that goes a long way for getting through the days. Read the 36 Hour Day, read and watch everything you can from Teepa Snow (super super helpful) and find a good support group on Facebook (caregivers hub support group is my favorite). Make sure you know how to do assist her with mobility- how to hold her arm when getting her up, how to get her into bed, etc. Read up on the type of dementia, the stages and characteristics of each, and how to handle common ""problem behaviors."" Be prepared for this to test your patience in every way imaginable. Be prepared for all reason and logic to go out the window. Don't be afraid to get creative when problem solving!! 

Other things that may make your life easier: stick-on door alarms are cheap and work great, a baby monitor for her bedroom, hygiene aids (shower seat, disposable shampoo cap, body wipes), lockable/hidden medicine organizer.

Shit, call every day until someone listens to you. Also those medications listed do not slow the progression of the disease nor do they return memory function. As explained by our neurologist they only lessen the symptoms of the disease so that people who interact with said person aren't always driven to the point of insanity themselves. 

TAKE HER CAR KEYS. Do not take the car. Just the keys. Don't even say anything. This woman does not need to be driving. If you do this you need to accept responsibility for providing food and whatever else she needs. It is exhausting but I would sleep much better knowing she can't drive. Does your grandmother have any other children? You need to call them now. One of her children needs to have a legal evaluation and be established as POA or guardian/conservator. Once that happens the person chosen to take on this enormous responsibility can make decisions about her living arrangements, finances, etc. 

You have to keep shouting about this. Don't even talk to grandma about it. It's the other people in your life that need to listen! 

Let me also second medications for anxiety and depression. They are a must! It's good for grandma and good for everyone else. Also, if you can, seek help with any care she needs. I am caring for my father alone and it is exhausting and maddening to say the least. ",,,,mgcarter3,,,1467812998,t5_2rfqf,t3_4rg4gv,t3_4rg4gv,2,1471239961,0,0,d51cmqs,dementia,2,,

"My late grandma would say the same. My mother still owned the house she lived in all her life so she would constantly drive between the two often up to twice a week (100 mile one way) to placate her. She was highly intelligent and a dominant personality so couldn't be reasoned with. I found that it was best to answer a question with another question, that was the only way to avoid her bending the conversation to her demands and driving my mother to tears. We all had to work to keep her awake until midnight at least so that we could all get sleep. My grandma told us she wanted to die and stopped eating.

"You aren't failing. And I don't know about what your doctor was trying to convey but proper care will not stop the progression of the disease, it will only make the behaviors less severe in theory. There is no treatment for dementia in terms of stopping the progression that I am aware of. Take my opinion with a grain of salt as I am not an MD but dementia care has been my life for the past 3 years. 

Have you discussed the possibility with her doctor about an anti anxiety or other medication that may help the delusions? Her crying ever day is not good. This needs to be seriously looked at by a doctor or psychologist. 

Trust me you are not failing, and I know how you are feeling. It is horrible to feel like you are making no progress and your efforts feel totally wasted. They aren't wasted. She needs someone who understands her, who can calm her, who can advocate for her when doctors just try to shrug their shoulders. 

You want to feel some sort of momentum? Focus on getting her crying seriously addressed by a doctor. You may have to really push. In my experience most doctors are like 'well this is dementia so deal with it'. That isn't a medical answer. Your mom is having breakdowns every day. If meds won't help, maybe a psychologist trained in geriatric and impaired psychology will be able to pinpoint what may help and give you better tools to help her because right now you are kind of flying blind and that's not your fault.

Until then, take most of the stuff out if her room and put it elsewhere. Leave just enough to be placed in a small piece of luggage because for her packing is a comfort. Leave her the comfort, just make the quantity of it manageable for you as well if possible. 

Have you tapped into her world as a form of redirection? Maybe try to get her to 'bake' something for the kings servants who are coming to pick her up as a gesture of thanks. Maybe make them cards. Make her time constructive but do it within her world. Redirect her to a constructive task to look forward to. 

Im just stabbing in the dark. I know that what you wrote is just the tip of the iceberg and you feel like you are drowning. Hugs! Feel free to PM me if you need to. ",,,,DoctorFlimFlam,,,1469564879,t5_2rfqf,t3_4uqdra,t3_4uqdra,8,1471700709,0,0,d5rz9qp,dementia,8,,
"Shoot. Well, know that you have NOT failed miserably. You can only do what you're capable of, and your own mental health/stress level needs to be accounted for. Don't ever feel like you need to be doing more if you simply CAN'T. It is not your job to make her happy. The illness doesn't seem to allow that with her. You can keep her fed, clean, and safe. That is more than enough right now.

I would see if you can get a prescription for anti-psychotics for her. They typically are overused in Alzheimer's patients, but it sounds like her behaviour warrants it. It would help you and the rest of the caregivers too.

Again, best of luck and sending love.",,,,missthinks,,,1469573001,t5_2rfqf,t3_4uqdra,t1_d5s5nql,1,1471703830,0,0,d5s5uhc,dementia,1,,
"Thanks for the feedback all-currently living from savings whilst getting benefits in order. Never thought about POA-will definitely look into that asap. 

I've worked within dementia care before but that was always when a person had had it for a while-I've never seen it happen from the start so that is scary,especially when it's someone so close-and they don't think there is a problem.

"If you can afford it; then absolutely! For everything that you see, there are probably a dozen things that she has managed to hide from you, or that have happened when no one was aware.

A companion will also help boost her mood and outlook, by helping her regain some semblance of independence. 

Don't put a whole lot of stock in what the doctor says. She needs to be seen by a specialist (neuropsychiatrist, I want to say?) who knows how to run the tests. My father-in-law was stubborn, because he feared being put in a nursing home. Unfortunately, that's what ended up being the only way to take care of him.

I found the best approach (which didn't set off his alarm bells about dementia) was to say ""I've noticed that you've been behaving a little bit differently. You know that mini-strokes can cause memory loss; and that early diagnosis and treatment can mean the difference between a good prognosis or ending up in a nursing home."" I presented it as getting looked at could mean keeping his freedom for longer.

The hardest part in all of this is that you will have to become a really good liar. When someone gets to the point where they can no longer care for themselves (yet are still able to express their wishes) you may have to deceive them, in order to look after their best interests. Don't feel guilty about this, as long as you are taking good care of them. At this point, they are regressing back to the mentality of a child, and you have to protect them as you would a child.
