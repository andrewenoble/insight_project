"I just lost my mother to Alzheimer's Disease. She started showing signs 7 years prior, but lived at home with my dad and an older brother, who moved home to look after both parents. As time moved on, her symptoms progressed. She would forget seemingly insignificant things. But many times, she would start cooking in the kitchen, walk out of the room and forget what she had gone into the next room for. My brother found pans sizzling away on more than one occasion. 
When my dad died three years ago, mom's disease immediately became very apparent to the rest of my siblings. She had forgotten several brothers and sisters names and looked at them like they were strangers when they came to visit.

She spent nearly a full year reduced to monosyllabic words. She could not describe the fluffy things in the sky. ""The poof balls up there.""

It was 6 months before she died that she completely forgot me. That was okay, because I knew it was the disease. In January of this past year, we all gathered for what we thought would be her final moment on earth. She lasted an extra 4 months, defying her physician's expectations.

Alzheimer's is a terrible disease. If you feel a strong sense of responsibility for your mother, I would recommend that you really consider not providing care for her. She will be better suited in a memory care unit. She could linger in her present state for years. My mother's mind went first, followed slowly by her body, which was in remarkable shape for a woman her age. At 85, her heart finally stopped beating and she gave her final breath relinquishing the disease that had gripped her. 
There is nothing you can really do, except visit your mother frequently. It is not selfish for you to want a life. You have to ask yourself if you would visit her as frequently if she was healthy? She may have some adjustment to a new facility, but as my mother's disease progressed, she didn't even recognize her surroundings. You have to ask yourself also; who are you doing this for? Her? she won't remember you in a few months. You? Why? She will have the best care available in a MCU. Her condition is now up to trained professionals.

I hate for my answer to be drug him, but both a daily antidepressant and Ativan have helped. The antidepressant puts a positive spin on things.  The Ativan I use for bad days when he is agitated or angry. I also have worked to approach things differently. If something in particular is a constant argument I look for a work around. He has issues with moving to the bed at night. He watches Netflix I set up for him on the computer at a desk and even though he can watch the same show from a tv by the bed it's an argument.

"First as someone with a loved one that has AD, let me say thank you for being a friend to the family. This is a problem (like so many with AD) without a single solution. Being there for your friend as a shoulder to cry on may be the best thing you can do. Perhaps you can make an effort to do things with your friend away from home to distract? Or simply take your friends mother someplace calm and enjoyable once in a while to give your friend a break at home. I take my Partner to a koi pond at a nearby resort and feed the fish as a distraction on his good days. He enjoys it but it's also calming. I have found that music has stayed with my partner even when other things have gone so perhaps just sing a common song and if she responds try it again when your friend is within hearing, I find it a way to reach my partner even when he is unreachable. This is a terrible disease and the best thing you can do is be there and do your best to make sure the memories left with the family are good ones. I have a friend who schedules one afternoon a month to come over. She brings popcorn and spends 3 hours watching what ever my partner picks on Netflix with him. They enjoy it, he gets time with others, I get 3 hours to myself. She says such a short amount of time once a month doesn't really impact her life, but boy does it impact mine! That 3 hours is magical!!!! It's coming up and I splurged and set up a massage. There will be time after and I may go for a quiet meal!

My suggestion is to find a memory care facility with separate units for early and late stage Alzheimer's.

My mom was kicked out of a few places for behavioral issues and treated badly by other residents who didn't have similar memory or behavioral issues.  I found a memory care facility with separate early and late stage units.

"Talk to the social worker at any nursing home about getting him on Medicaid. They will guide you through the process and any decent nursing home will delay billing until he's set up with Medicaid. Forget about assisted living, they're regulated differently and although your parents could live together in an assisted living facility, they could never afford that. 

Finding housing for your mother is another struggle, but she should be allowed to pay for her living expenses as a ""spend down"" to get your dad to the point that he's eligible for Medicaid. Usually Medicaid will charge a surviving spouse for her partner's expenses after his death in the form of a lien on their property, but if they have no assets, there's not much to worry about. Your mom would still be able to own one vehicle after his death. 

If you haven't yet, have your parents add you or the sibling that can be best trusted with money to their bank accounts.

I also do a few things to calm him. I make sure he is in his room as he feels safer there. I try to always leave his room exactly as it was so that there are fewer confusing things for him there.

"What part of Washington? UW had a memory and/or dementia research/treatment center, they might have information that could help with this decision...

Also, is she taking any medications? 

My mom got started on prozac in the fairly early stages, as it was considered possible that her problems were caused by depression. Eventually it became clear that that wasn't the problem, so the Prozac was discontinued, but that caused her behavior to become much more problematic, for caregivers, but also for her, as she would get very upset over small things, and of course it's not fun for people to get very upset even if they are less than ""all there"".

So if she's not already taking any medication aimed at helping her feel content, it would probably be well worth looking into. I think you're concerned about your future career is very well placed. So if your mom's happiness can be enhanced without you having to quit working, that seems like the best of all possible worlds... 

Again, that memory Center associated with the UW might be a good place to start with what medication options make sense, especially in case her doctor is not well versed in that approach.

"Since your dad is a Vet, please look for a state Veteran's Home. In my state, it is a LOT cheaper than private care. This is different than the aid and attendance benefit. I am unsure whether A&amp;A can be applied toward the cost of a veteran's home, but if so then you may find the majority is covered.

My father in law is in a VH close to where we live. It's about 1/3 the cost of where he was before. He does have some assets and a decent retirement income so I think he's paying the maximum amount. My understanding is that the cost is prorated based on need, so it can be a very good deal. It also seems to be a more suitable environment for my FIL. Before, he was in a place where it was mostly women so most of the activities were female-friendly (he only has so much interest in chick flicks) and he thus spent most of his time in his room. Now at least he spends more time out with the other residents, and participates in some of the activities. Not to make it sound like there are a lot of exciting things all the time, but some of the activities they've done in the past are fishing, cook-outs, bowling, and a ball game so what there is seems to be more guy-friendly.

The Veteran's Homes, cost, and eligibility vary from state to state. We also had about a 6-month wait for the memory care unit.

Also, if you haven't done so already please contact a Veteran's Service Officer (http://nvf.org/veteran-service-officers/) and don't try to navigate benefits alone. The VSO's we've encountered seem dedicated to making sure veterans are getting every single they deserve. Since your dad is Vietnam-era, some diseases like diabetes may entitle him to benefits so if he has other health issues please do investigate since that can help with finances quite a bit. My own father was a Vietnam vet and due to possible exposure to agent orange (http://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/claims-postservice-agent_orange.asp), he was granted benefits because of his type 2 diabetes. He was very surprised that this was mentioned to him, as it never would have crossed his mind.

Sorry for the late response.  Thanks for the good advice. I have done the SSDI route and that helps.

"Yes, that is a ridiculous price. You could hire a companion(s) privately through care.com, and it still wouldn't add up to nearly that much. For frame of reference, we pay $1100 weekly for 24/6 care, in-home.  $12,000/month is an exorbitant fee and beyond ridiculous. For $12K monthly, you could bring him home and hire two live-in aides. 

Yes, memory care is designed to keep patients safe, but nothing is fool proof. Most people with dementia aren't able to scale a 8 foot wall. My question is why this area isn't supervised. It's great that the patients have access to it, but why is there no staff member close at hand to divert these escape attempts? 

What is the facility doing to keep him entertained? What are they doing to distract him, when he tries to escape? Does he express a particular reason for wanting to leave, such as needing to work or take care of the kids? White lies may divert his attention.

That fee honestly makes me think that perhaps they're trying to dissuade you from keeping him there. Perhaps they can't handle his level of activity. 

IF you bring him home, think very very very carefully about that. Changes in environment are a big deal, and moving to a somewhat similar memory care unit may be an easier transition than moving back home (and potentially back into a NH if it doesn't work out). Deadbolts and alarm systems are NOT a bad thing at home. They are the only way to keep a wanderer safe. It may seem like jail, but the potential for injury and getting lost is too high. There are ways to install the locks so that they don't really notice. Keep in mind that unless you have a large house, you won't be able to let him outside independently- even a fenced yard is not enough, if he's climbing 8 foot walls. He will need constant supervision. 

If I were you, I'd hire a companion for his waking hours (I assume he doesn't have access to this courtyard at night), and see if this helps and if you can troubleshoot to stop the escape attempts. If it continues, I'd move him to a more secure unit.",,,,applesangria,,,1468520613,t5_2r8fp,t3_4stw0y,t3_4stw0y,2,1471428976,0,0,d5c9qk7,Alzheimers,2,,

*If your father was in the military there may be great options for him.
*If your father has an injury that requires ""rehab"" he can go to a Skilled Nursing Facility and medicare will probably pay.  They pay nothing on Assisted Living Complexes.  
*It's possible that a doctor will decide your father is suitable for hospice care which medicare often pays for, but the doctor has to be comfortable certifying that your father is within 6 months of death.  Some Doctor's have no problem with this due to the unpredictable nature of AD, others hold off.  
*If your father has any gait issues (trouble walking) is weak, has trouble getting up and down out of a chair, its possible a doctor will prescribe home health and its possible medicare will cover most or all of it.   This is temporary as medicare has a finite # of days of the year they will pay for rehabilitation care and if he should need it for other reasons later in the year it could cause problems.  
*I would also search out Alzheimer's support groups near your mother, they often know the local ins and outs.  
*Check to see if they have a council on aging office (normally a county provided office).  
*Some assisted living complexes have ""day camps"" and outings you can pay a fee for.  This may provide a much needed break for your mother even if it can't happen often due to finances.

"I work in the memory care unit of a nursing home. There is one man who can't remember that his wife died. She died over 20 years ago, long before his Alzheimers ever began. He constantly asks where she is and calls for her when he needs help. We try not to lie, but we don't tell him that she died. There are only two things that can happen: he doesn't believe us, which just leads to him not trusting us, or he gets so upset that he cannot be calmed. His family lives several states away and are only able to visit a few times every year. They always tell him at some point that she has died, which only makes him upset, and therefore them upset. Sometimes he will remember she has died for several days, during which he doesn't eat much, communicate his needs, and doesn't want to get out of bed. It is very bad for his health, which is why the nurses at our nursing home don't want us to tell him the truth. Why make him miserable if it won't do any good? When he believes she's simply at the grocery store or napping, he brushes his teeth and uses the bathroom, does his exercises, eats meals, talks to us and the other residents, etc. All things that he doesn't do when he knows his wife is dead. He is much happier thinking she is alive and that's how we let him live out the rest of his days. 

It is possible that your grandmother would never believe you, even if you tried to tell her. But she may get upset or angry. People with Alzheimers tend to not trust easily, so she may think you're keeping her from him or trying to fool her and become very hard to work with. It may be better to tell her that he's gone fishing or something that he actually would do, depending on how long her memory lasts. A few hours? You can tell her that every single day. She will think he's happy and she will be happy.

"Very interesting study. The full research article is linked below.

http://www.nature.com/articles/npjamd201612

It is important to realize that this study was done entirely in a petri dish, using human brain cancer cells from a tumor. These results will hopefully translate into future animal and human studies, but it is still way too early to know.

Most of this paper focused on inflammation in neurons that are artificially forced to produce amyloid beta, the neurotoxin present in Alzheimer's. Interestingly, they conclude the cannabinoid PGD2 is neuroprotective, where previous other studies have concluded the opposite results. This is something they fail to acknowledge or explain in their discussion. They claim that the cannabinoid THC is the most neuroprotective of the cannabinoids, which is an exciting finding, even in an artificial system. Finally, the most exciting result is the demonstration that blocking the RAGE protein is neuroprotective. Currently, there is a large human clinical trial recruiting to determine if anti-RAGE drugs will slow Alzheimer's progression. This paper supports this hypothesis, and we will see the results in the next few years.

"I think this is one of those cases where the mechanisms are off but the end result is correct.  THC binds to a g protein-coupled receptor (cannabinoid receptors).  These receptors with prolonged activation can contribute to short-term memory loss.

https://www.elsevier.com/connect/preventing-marijuana-induced-memory-problems-with-OTC-painkillers

However, these receptors are damaged by oxidation in Alzheimer's disease and thus THC no longer has a negative effect on memory.  Other g protein-coupled receptors damaged in Alzheimer's disease include those that govern short-term memory, mood, sleep, smell, social recognition, and alertness.

The second mechanism mistake is to assume that amyloid plaques cause Alzheimer's disease.  All efforts to remove plaques to treat Alzheimer's disease have failed in the past.  Several constituents in the marijuana will de-nitrate plaques which allows for their removal or degradation.  But the key positive aspect of the constituents of CBD oil--THC, cannabidiol, and terpenes--is to scavenge the oxidant peroxynitrite and to reverse part of nitro-oxidative stress that likely causes Alzheimer's disease.",,,,Lane_Simonian,,,1467476382,t5_2r8fp,t3_4qouao,t1_d4uq4rz,1,1471159232,0,0,d4wp4yl,Alzheimers,1,,
"hey thanks for the reply. He served in the National Guard way back when, and I don't know how long he served or if that matters. Another wrench in the gears here is that when he was a kid, his last name was changed when his mother remarried, and at some point in his adult life he started using his original again without ever legally changing it (we found this out a few months ago). So a lot of employment, along with military, records are going to be under the wrong name. And since he no longer uses that name, he has no way of proving his second last name. Such a mess. 

He sort of has trouble walking, but not really any more than any other ~80 year old, he's just kind of slow. He has no physical injuries that would call for rehab. He hardly eats anymore, though, really tough to see him go from 5' 7"" 180 lbs down to 5' 4"" 110lbs. 

Blah sorry to rant, but I'll definitely look into the military thing. I really appreciate all your help. Might take you up on that PM later on. Thanks!",,,,BKlounge93,,,1467597773,t5_2r8fp,t3_4qp3bh,t1_d4vuy1f,1,1471187631,0,0,d4yc0rs,Alzheimers,1,,

"Very interesting study. The full research article is linked below.

It is important to realize that this study was done entirely in a petri dish, using human brain cancer cells from a tumor. These results will hopefully translate into future animal and human studies, but it is still way too early to know.

Most of this paper focused on inflammation in neurons that are artificially forced to produce amyloid beta, the neurotoxin present in Alzheimer's. Interestingly, they conclude the cannabinoid PGD2 is neuroprotective, where previous other studies have concluded the opposite results. This is something they fail to acknowledge or explain in their discussion. They claim that the cannabinoid THC is the most neuroprotective of the cannabinoids, which is an exciting finding, even in an artificial system. Finally, the most exciting result is the demonstration that blocking the RAGE protein is neuroprotective. Currently, there is a large human clinical trial recruiting to determine if anti-RAGE drugs will slow Alzheimer's progression. This paper supports this hypothesis, and we will see the results in the next few years.

"I think the goal here is to minimize the fear and stress that comes with a move. If you remove her from the packing moving and unpacking it will be less confusing, less scary and she will be more comfortable. It's confusing to move when you are healthy. A day or two before the move I would bring it up as well as the day of the move, but involve her as little as possible for the actual move. She will have a hard time adjusting either way, but this way she doesn't enter the situation already stressed to the max with all the moving prep.
