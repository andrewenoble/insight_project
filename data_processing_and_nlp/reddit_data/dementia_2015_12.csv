"It might sound cruel to people who don't know what a PD is like, but my thought is, why do anything to extend things? My MIL ended up breaking her hip, and that put her in a hospital, then a rehab, and we transitioned her directly into a nursing home from there. They don't know about her PD, and just chalk it all up to dementia.

 It's been an incredible relief. Now we know she's eating well, getting her meds correctly, and has company. Before, she was shut in her house, mostly by herself, and not able to manage daily tasks well.

She's doing so much better now. I mean, she's still the same personality wise, but she's taken well to the environment. She was a nurse, so it fells familiar to be in such a setting. Much better than being at home. She still tries to lay a guilt trip on my husband all the time, but it's easier for him to ignore it now that he knows she's getting good care.",,,,JustMeRC,,,1451500698,t5_2rfqf,t3_3yslgp,t1_cygdfuq,5,1451943341,0,0,cygdtv0,dementia,5,,

"Yes. 

It has been my experience that it is harder for people with dementia to hide their true selves, even though, Out of Habit, they will try.

This is a link from a post I read last week here on reddit. 

(https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3xqnw5/eli5_do_people_with_alzheimers_retain_prior/?)

I have also read other articles but did not save a copy of the links.

All dementia/Alzheimer's patients are difficult to care for. Some  more or less than others. But if your MIL has a Personality Disorder, or Borderline Personality Disorder, or Bipolar, or just some pretty major issues she will more than likely be more difficult to care for.

I cannot guarantee success with this, but if you are curious about your MIL, I have a suggestion. If you visit her from time to time and you know one of her hands-on caregivers that you feel will be upfront and truthful with you, ask then if your MIL is a little more difficult to handle than some the others. For me, this is always the first sign. Keep in mind, that being more difficult does not always mean they have a mental disorder, for instance, a man that has a big ego can be difficult, but if they have a mental disorder they usually are more difficult. 

A couple years ago, I was the caregiver for a lady with Alzheimer's that had some undiagnosed mental health issues. Actually, this lady was one of my best friends MIL. Anyway, she was the most difficult person that I ever cared for. I suspected she did have some type of mental issues, but I did not know for sure until my friend (her daughter-in-law) confirmed my suspicions. She is now in a Assisted Living Facility the specializes in Memory Care, and she is one of their more difficult patients. But this is what they are trained to do, and she is receiving very good care.

It doesn't get better but it gets easier. Dad has been going through alzheimers for the last 5 years or so and my mother was his primary caretaker. We lost her in 2014 to cancer so his kids (me &amp; 2 older sibs) are carrying for him. It was brutal for the first year. But it will get easier.

We realized it was time to move a step in care when my relative called the police on her home health aid when she went out to have a prescription filled and told them the aide had broken in the house and stolen the car.

"Hi, thanks for your response, it is so nice to get some words of support. I do think his depression has caused permanent chemical changes in his apperception and brain functions. 

His therapists have all really sucked, I agree. When I told his first therapist, ""he won't bathe,"" she said ""well just pinch your nose to signal to him he needs to bathe."" 

I was like, uhhh, we all tell him directly, ""You can't come in here stinking like that, take a shower, right now,""  he argues with me that he doesn't have to . . .  so I don't think a subtle nose pinch is gonna cut it, babe. 

Every doctor and professional he has had, has failed him, except his urologist. 

I will be making a concerted and intense effort to personally take him to a psychiatrist and geriatric specialist. He can't do anything alone-- he will lie or pretend he has no idea why he is there.

One thing I didn't mention above, is that Dad scheduled himself for a ""heart catheterization"" without telling anyone.  

He was supposed to have someone come and pick him up after the procedure, and they would not release him. He tried to sneak out of the hospital, while sedated, and drive away, and was caught and held. They called our house and we were all busy, and no one could get him-- because he didn't tell anyone he was having surgery.

This, (combined with leaving the burners on, serving rotten food to people, etc) to me shows he is a danger to himself and others. 

Do you think I'm right that this is a major warning sign he is no longer safe all the time? His doctors seemed to not give a darn.

"I totally agree with LadyInTheWindow that what you did for your MIL was the very best for everyone. However, as a professional caregiver for the elderly with dementia, that has a lot of contact with doctors and clinicians, most geriatric clinicians can still recognize when a dementia patient also has a mental disorder. Mental disorders do carry over into early and moderate dementia (last stages everyone is pretty much the same). However, unless there is a prior known diagnosis of the mental disorder, dementia becomes so dominate that a diagnosis of the type of mental disorder becomes extremely difficult or even impossible. 

My point being, that most nurses, clinicians, CNA's, and others that have a lot of experience with dementia patients can usually tell when a patient also has some type of mental disorder. I can, unless it is something relatively minor, as well as most people I know that work with dementia patients. Actually, it's already been studied.

"The Alzheimer pandemic: is paracetamol to blame?
Jones GR1.
Author information
Abstract
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND:

The clinical recognition of a form of dementia closely resembling Alzheimer's disease dates from around 1800. The role of analgesics derived from coal-tar in the spread of the pandemic is traced in terms of the introduction of phenacetin (PN) in 1887; its nephrotoxicity; the observation of lesions characteristic of the disease by Fischer and Alzheimer; the discovery of paracetamol (PA) as the major metabolite of PN; the linking of kidney injury and dementia with high PN usage; and the failure of PN replacement by PA to halt and reverse the exponential, inexorable rise in the incidence of Alzheimer-type dementia. Fischer observed his first case before Alzheimer; it is proposed to rename the syndrome Fischer-Alzheimer disease (F-AD). Disease development: PA-metabolising enzymes are localised in the synaptic areas of the frontal cortex and hippocampus, where F-AD lesions arise. The initiating chemical lesions in liver poisoning comprise covalent binding of a highly reactive product of PA metabolism to proteins; similar events are believed to occur in brain, where alterations in the antigenic profiles of cerebral proteins activate the microglia. β-Amyloid forms, and, like PA itself, induces nitric oxide synthase. Peroxynitrite modifies cerebral proteins by nitrating tyrosine residues, further challenging the microglia and exacerbating the amyloid cascade. Spontaneous reinnervation, N-acetyl cysteine administration and tyrosine supplementation may attenuate the early stages of F-AD development.
CONCLUSION:

F-AD is primarily a man-made condition with PA as its principal risk factor.",,,,gameoverplayer1,,,1449591725,t5_2rfqf,t3_3vy15y,t3_3vy15y,1,1451515609,0,0,cxrmvpr,dementia,1,,

"Q1 -- Stress can exacerbate existing dementia for sure.  My elder had undiagnosed mild dementia and was living at home.  Then they got sick with a couple things at once and got knocked on their butt physically resulting in a hospitalization.  Being ill took them way into moderate symptoms.  There were hallucinations, they couldn't tell you the correct month, and they tried to dress incorrectly.  It became suddenly apparent that they needed to be released from the hospital into 24-hour care situation.  After going from the hospital to an assisted living facility, they improved almost to that same baseline mentally before the more progressive deterioration hit.  

That deterioration was jagged, I'd say.  Like you could put a slow sloping trendline to the thing.  But if you considered individual hours to be data points it varied quite a bit.  Lunch was usually  a fairly alert time, whenever they caught a cold they'd be pretty loony.  If they were sleepy, they'd be pretty confused too.

Treasure the moments you've shared and learn to love your new role in her life. Just be available to talk to her and hold her hand and let her dictate the terms of the relationship from now on. If she's tired, let her sleep. If she's awake and feeling good, embrace those times as well. It won't be the same interactions you're used to, but you can still contribute in a meaningful way by just being present and loving.

"Love your user name. I totally get it. 

What are the odds that you will have Dementia......ask your GP or Therapist. They may be able to give you the odds, however, they will only be making an educated guess. If you are determined to find out your genetic risk, have a DNA test performed. However, a DNA test will only be able to determine your ODDS of getting Alzheimer's, and will not give you a definite answer. Hopefully soon there will be more definitive tests, but for now, it just a wait and see. 

I also wonder every day what my odds of getting Dementia will be. My mom has Alz. I am in my 50's, and I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety many years ago. Like you, I have been navigating my symptoms along with trying to live independently and have as normal life as possible. As you know, this can be very difficult at times, and then when you throw in the public stigma that still surrounds mental health issues, it can be isolating as well. Which is not what you need to feel/do when you are dealing with episodes of depression and anxiety. It's like a revolving door of doing well in life just to have LIFE HAPPEN which can throw you back into that all to familiar struggle AGAIN. Now that my mom has Alz., and I am one of her caregivers, I find myself struggling once again with my depression and anxiety. 

One thing I have learned is, I can only be my moms caregiver a few hours a week. I do not know what your situation is and for you this may not be possible. I love my mom dearly, but if I cannot take care of myself, I cannot be the caregiver she needs. Try to enlist as much help as possible from family, friends, and paid caregivers. If possible, have a weekly schedule including you and all caregivers. Maybe, (just a suggestion) let other caregivers take care of your mom during most of her day or awake hours and you take the night shift. That way you will have time you can count on to take care of other responsibilities as well as yourself. Take some of that time to get a message, get your hair done, go shopping, or take a nap. Things that are good for you. Whatever your odd's for eventually getting Alzheimer's, you may be able to lessen if, you have boundaries where your mother's illness is concerned, and you take the time to take care of yourself WITHOUT GUILT.

"""if its Alzheimer's, then what's the difference, nothing can be done"". 

The answer to this is that your Mom needs to have an established relationship with a neurologist or geriatric doctor so that, as her symptoms progress, she can be put on medication and receive other care to help relieve her suffering.  While it's true there is no *cure* for dementia, there are medicines to *slow its progress* and treatments to help with the *anxiety* and *paranoia* that are to come.   Trying to seek qualified medical help in the middle of a crisis versus having an established patient-doctor relationship before she reaches crisis stage will be  immensely helpful to all of you.   

Since she has experience in caring for your Grandmother,  she should realize that digging in her heels on this will just make your life exponentially more difficult as time goes on.   So, if she's not motivated to help herself, ask her to do this in order to help *you*. 

Also, obviously, she needs to make legal arrangements such as naming her Power of Attorney for health care matters and a POA for financial matters plus get her will/trust in order. ",,,,Jewel_332211,,,1449249305,t5_2rfqf,t3_3pylue,t3_3pylue,1,1451437414,0,0,cxn3jir,dementia,1,,

"""Just getting old"" is a very common way that many people brush off this medical condition.  And, because there's no cure for dementia, it's easy to just shrug one's shoulders and do nothing.  But, as you know, it's important to get a diagnosis for many reasons, such as establishing a relationship with a neurologist so that future medical needs associated with dementia can be handled promptly.  Also, if your partner's Grandma hasn't already completed advanced directive and POA paperwork, getting a diagnosis may create the urgency needed to get it done.

I sense that you have picked up that Grandma doesn't think there's anything wrong with her.   Anosognosia is extremely common in dementia suffers.   Unfortunately, that just makes caregiving that much more stressful.  

If your partner already has POA for healthcare matters, it would be a good idea to contact Grandma's primary physician to alert the doctor of the symptoms and see if the doctor will recommend that Grandma make an appointment with a neurologist for testing.   If it comes from the doctor, it may make the situation more palatable for Grandma versus if you/SO suggest it.

As far as convincing your SO, it sounds like he/she needs to be shown how far Grandma's symptoms have progressed.   There's nothing better for that then giving your SO the list of dementia ""stages"" and having him/her spend a lot of time with Grandma.   Then, as Grandma demonstrates the symptoms, you can point to that example in private conversations with your SO as proof.

Lastly, come on over to the Caregiver Forum Board at www.alzconnected.org    You'll receive a lot more advice and information there.

He says over and over that he's not cut out for this...he was a sergeant in the army (WWII) and is used to giving orders and moving quickly, not being patient, not trying to ""interpret"" or troubleshoot and not interested in any namby-pamby/touchy-feely solutions. 

I have to admit that the phone is still not in use, but in my case it's because the very concept of a cell phone is foreign to my grandmother (even though my granddad has had a flip phone for years), never mind one with a touch/swipe screen. She's gotten the hang of Big Launcher itself, but the steps of pushing a button and,swiping to start, swiping to answer (to add insult to injury, the phone I bought has a picky swipe screen and if she swipes in the wrong direction she ends up in the wrong place), tapping instead of pressing, and not wrapping her fingers onto the screen...(I recently bought a case that helps with the last problem, and I'm going to try outlining the ""Back"" button with nailpolish...). 

If anyone knows of an Android phone that doesn't require swiping... Or of a  normal-looking phone that can be plugged into/powered by a cell phone... (Say, one of those large-button corded phones where numbers have been replaced by photos/names, but connected to a cellphone instead of a wall jack... They've figured out how to connect keyboards, mice, game controllers to cell phones, so why not a telephone-shaped phone?

Anyway, hateboss, I hope that Big Launcher is a solution that works for you/your stepmom. ",,,,khaoti,,,1449511905,t5_2rfqf,t3_3t11zn,t3_3t11zn,1,1451495869,0,0,cxqhqj7,dementia,1,,

"&gt;was like, uhhh, we all tell him directly, ""You can't come in here stinking like that, take a shower, right now,"" he argues with me that he doesn't have to . . . so I don't think a subtle nose pinch is gonna cut it, babe. 

Total agree. I can't believe she said that.

&gt; I will be making a concerted and intense effort to personally take him to a psychiatrist and geriatric specialist. He can't do anything alone-- he will lie or pretend he has no idea why he is there.

Great idea. Also, tell them everything that is going on with your father. Everything.

&gt;Do you think I'm right that this is a major warning sign he is no longer safe all the time? His doctors seemed to not give a darn. 

There is absolutely no doubt that your father is a danger to himself and possibly others. Something major is going on with your dad and don't let up until you find a doctor that will help you figure this out. He could have some type of physical illness or he could have a mental heath problem or he could have some type of Dementia. But there is a problem!

When you and the docs figure out what's going on with him, he may need someone to come to his home to assist him on a daily basis. If he rejects this, you may be forced to put him in a assisted living facility. If it comes to this, more than likely, he will be very angry with you for awhile. But do not let that stop you from protecting your father and doing what you know is best for him. Good Luck.

"My grandfather also has LBD and hearing and vision loss and I've found the best activity is to reminisce about old times or ask questions about when he was young. Talking to him about any memories that involve my grandma confuse him or make him sad but he can still recall most of his childhood memories and it makes him happy to think about those times. 


I usually avoid asking a lot of questions and instead tell him things like ""You know what I was thinking about the other day? The time we went to Washington for the family reunion. That was a lot of fun"" and if he remembers he participates. 


Sometimes I'll just talk to him about topics instead of specific things, like the other day I asked him if he believes in UFOs. 


It's hard to get him to do anything else and I've tried a lot, this is the one thing I can find that keeps his mood and our interactions positive.

If you *are* diagnosed with dementia, keep in mind that there are several different kinds, each with their own idiosyncrasies.

"I'm really sorry to hear about your situation with your mother. I think because you stepped up to the plate and took on her care the other siblings have been able to shirk their responsibilities. This likely comes from a place of guilt/fear and not an openly malicious place of selfishness. Dementia as you know is terrible and heart wrenching and slow.
The only thing you can do is tell them how you are feeling. While you may feel that it should be obvious to them how you feel and that they should be visiting more they will be blocking those feelings allowing their 'lives' to get in the way. 
I recommend after the holidays when emotions are not so highly charged that you go out with your siblings, to a neutral place and talk with them. No accusations, no shouting, write down what you want to say, let them know that you wish they would visit more, ask them to take on some responsibility so that they can see how much you do for your mother. I am also assuming here that all your siblings had a good relationship with your mother growing up. Because that is something else to consider,children owe their parents nothing if the parent-child relationship was a bad one.
I hope that you are able to find some happiness this holiday season and that you are able to talk with your siblings to see why they are not visiting often. 
My family does not visit my father, but that is because my mother is a psycho bitch and makes visiting him truly horrible (it is a long and shit story). I know he misses everyone, but I also know that he knew this would happen. It is heart breaking, but he chose her insanity and all.

"My MIL is similar. She has some kind of undiagnosed personality disorder (probaby BPD). She had therapy at various times in her life, for severe agoraphobia and anxiety, but never any meds except for a very small xanax, then swtiched to valium in recent years.

Now she's in her early 70's. She's always had some OCD-like behaviors: hoarding, obsessive checking, hypervigilance type stuff. Things have been getting progressively worse.

She went to a neurologist after a TIE (mini stroke) and was dignosed with early dementia. The truth is, Personality Disorder, dementia, other mental illness, small strokes, absence seizures...a lot of it runs together when people get older. The only way to get an official diagnosis is to see a neurologist and get the scans done. 

There may be something they can give her to keep dementia from progressing, but it goes together with other untreated mental illnesses. If she had any strokes, they could give her medication to regulate blood pressure and maybe blood thinners. I don't know what they do for absence seizures.

If you are with her, and she seems absent, you could call 911 for suspicion of stroke or seizure. That would be the easiest way to begin an evaluation with a neurologist if she's refusing to go on her own. Of course, she could refuse transport to the hospital.

"For most people, the odds of developing one of the various forms of dementia are not as high as you might think. The greatest risk factor is age, and your chances are adjusted by gender. For example, at 75, men have a 10% chance of developing Alzheimer's, and women have a 19% chance. [PDF report from alz.org here.](https://www.alz.org/facts/downloads/facts_figures_2015.pdf)

Those odds do have to be adjusted for other individual factors, and many of those factors are controllable. Good heart health, regular exercise, eating right, regular mental activity (sudoku, crosswords, reading!) all contribute to reducing your total risk. You are *not* fated to developing a form of dementia. You're only 35, so you have loads of time to improve your chances of not developing the disease.

"I think you need to get rid of the judgment about ""forcing"" someone to life in a group home.  There are so many issues at play.

First off, I've been involved in care decisions for three elders in the family. 

* Person 1 - I had the duty of convincing this elder to go into an assisted living facility.  They could have afforded in-home care.  Unfortunately, some decisions in prior years made that logistically problematic.  The crux of the issue was accessibility.  Due to mobility issues, the person developing a shuffle rather than walk, their home was no longer suitable.  Yes, it would have been easy to remove carpeting or to change exterior steps to a ramp.  But the lack of a first floor shower is what really made the decision.  Remodeling the house on that scale would have been extremely difficult.  Had that elder moved to a single-story home in retirement, remaining at home would have been possible longer.

* Person 2 Was obedient and used to following orders.  They lived in an accessible home that they took the time to remodel with old age in mind.  Person 2 died before progressing to severe dementia and never got beyond moderate.  Their spouse was healthy, they had several extended family members in the area.  Between the family and in-home caregivers they were able to remain at home.

* Person 3 Also lived in an accessible house near family.  That worked for a long period of time until it just didn't.  Eventually they became upset with caregivers and was a bit combative.  This was a problem because they were obese and not easy to life, especially when non-compliant.  There came a point where single-person lifts were not going to work.  Hiring 2 people round the clock would have drained their retirement savings blindingly fast.  So this person was moved to a facility that had specialized lift equipment and multiple CNAs on staff for any given shift.


In terms of what can be done to keep someone at home there are several things:

* replace normal carpeting with high-traffic carpet 
* install grab bars 
* keep floors clear of tripping hazards
* buy them accessible clothing 
* install a shower with a door &amp; seat or a wheelchair accessible shower
* get a hospital bed
* use alarms so you know if the person tries to get up unassisted or if they go into areas that they shouldn't
* be rich so you can hire 24/7 care
* be very mindful of fire hazards

"As a in-home caregiver, it has been my experience that early stage dementia/Alzheimer's is not to difficult to manage in a in-home setting. Moderate stage is more challenging and exhausting, but can usually be managed. However, once the patent start to displaying symptoms of confusion to the point that it is disrupting the home or that they could become a danger to themselves or others, Doctors will usually advise an assisted living facility. At a facility, the patent will get 24/7 professional care form many caregivers as one time. Some of my patents have progressed to the point that I can't safely care for them in their home anymore.

One very sad component to making proper arrangements and getting proper care for Dementia and Alzheimer's patents is Insurance. Medicare as well as private insurance have resisted providing the proper financial help need for someone with Dementia or Alzheimer's. Medicare will pay for only part time help of what they deem is necessary (customary). Which we all know (as well as them) is sub par at best. This will only change when Medicare and private insurance is forced by Congress and the President to change their policies.

"nursing home administrator here. While that is younger than the average age for a nursing home, age should not be a factor here with getting her into a facility. Most likely what needs to be looked at is the financial situation. Given that your mother is in her mid 40s, she probably has a primary payer in some type of insurance, and no secondary payer. You are taking the right steps by applying for medicaid, but your best bet is to meet with the business office at a facility, and comply with what they need to get you started on a medicaid pending case. This is typically 6 months of bank statements, any documentation on 401k, or other plans which might be a factor on getting her approved.



The best thing you can do is show the facility that you are completely compliant and timely with getting the information they need to determine if they will take on the pending case.
