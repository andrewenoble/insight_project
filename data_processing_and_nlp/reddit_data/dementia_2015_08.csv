"Thank you all for your responses. 

Recursive- we've tried therapy when she was slightly more lucid and it was a total failure. She couldn't express herself at all or understand the therapist (who specializes in speech disorders). And now her memory is so poor I doubt that anything imparted by the therapist would be understood or remembered. I really like your idea of adult day care. But she is **very** attached to my dad and will even look out the gate waiting for him. But I will check this out and see what's available. 

I may have misspoke. Our ""helper"" is more than just a maid, she takes my mom for walks downtown every time she's here and tries to interact with my mom in any way possible. A new caregiver is coming who is even more specialized. She loves to pet the dogs downtown and treats our family dog like a second child. Thank you for your support Recurs

Naked- I'm so sorry for your dad. It's great to have family around to help. We have some family around, but they're more ""fair weather family"" but I'm going to try talking to them more; I think a lot of them just don't know how to help. I will keep an eye out for social activities, I think just being around people helps. Classes could be an option but her cognition is so compromised I doubt she could even dip a paintbrush in a palette or cup. Still worth looking into, thanks! I wish you and your dad ll the best.

"My father's memory is at the same level--he will forget things w/in a minute generally. But his ""emotional memory"" seems longer. When he experiences strong emotions, positive or negative, those seem to stick around even if he doesn't recall the exact stuff. For example, when he has a really good few hours with someone he really enjoys, his buoyed mood stays and a few hours later he might vaguely recall seeing them if pressed (but it's like it's a dream he's forgotten, he says). In the inverse, when he's really emotionally engaged in something sad or frustrating, he might still be angry and agitated at us later. 

I think counseling for clients like him and your mother would have to look different, focusing on immediate mood therapy, rather than sustained over time. A normal therapist might do more harm than good, leaving them in a more agitated/sad state, but without being able to really self-soothe since they don't know why they feel that way.

My father has depressive periods, but there's no way he'd do either medication or counseling either before dementia or now. His seem to be related to missing his family of origin on some level, particularly his twin who died as a young adult. We try to pay attention to his moods and work to mitigate them. I don't think his is clinical depression, but circumstantial, so we work to address what might be bothering him (he's not a huge sharer, but he'll often say the rough outline of why he's sad). 

His sadness seems to come out of a sense of failure for ""letting"" family members die, or a fear that they will be forgotten by him/others. So we talk about them a lot, in mostly happy memories ways. We sometimes visit the cemetery and then take pics while we're there and talk about it later. 

Sometimes certain books, etc., will trigger sadness. I had to take a Kennedy family biography away from him because he kept (re)reading it and getting really upset/sad. We also were going to go to BLM protests, but are backing off on that because hearing about police brutality really upsets him (hence he wanted to go) and that agitation/anger transfers to us.

We also work to make sure that he has the things that might help with depression: solid sleep, healthy food (inc. regular probiotics), daily exercise, social contact, a sense of purpose/independence/meaning. Since he's not a touchy-feely guy and never has been, we've come up with our own ways of providing loving touch without making him feel like his bodily autonomy is being challenged--lotion on dry skin in the winter with permission, squeezing together on the couch to watch something, holding hands while walking (like when we were little kids--also helps with his stability).

"&gt;I don't want to see my grandmother anymore now that she's in this state, because it really gets to me and i know it would upset me quite a lot, but on the other, i wouldn't mind going to see her, because i'm hoping that there's still a little piece of memory in her mind that hasn't forgotten me.

I can understand your not wanting to see your grandmother anymore, and it makes much more sense than going to see her just so you can confirm that she still remembers who you are. If she were dying of cancer or ALS, would you be hoping that your presence would somehow ease her pain? It wouldn't, just as your presence is not likely to jog her memory. 

To have a grandmother live into her nineties is a great gift. She could have easily been taken from all of you 20 years ago and you would not have gotten to know her at all. Dementia is a horrible way to die, but much more so for the loved ones who must watch the decline and realize that the patient can't even take comfort in their presence since she no longer knows them.

If you don't want to visit your grandmother, don't go. If your mother were to tell you she asked for you, then maybe a visit is in order, but there's no telling if, when you are there, she will know you. If you can control your discomfort at her not knowing who you are, you could just pose as a kind young woman who is looking in on an elderly lady, call her by her first name,  ask her if there's anything she'd like, or bring her a food treat that she's known to have enjoyed or some music that might comfort her, or a photography book with pix of cats or dogs or beautiful scenes of nature, something that she might like. Or you could ask her if she'd just like to hold your hand for awhile without falling back on, ""Grandmum, it's me, Ninja, don't you remember me?""

Don't feel pressured to force yourself to visit, tho'. When your grandmother gets to where she's going I sincerely doubt she will hold it against you, for she will be absorbed in her new journey.",false,false,t1_cum4t6k,sadatay,,0,1441047964,t5_2rfqf,t3_3j0iql,t3_3j0iql,2,1441611311,0,0,cum4t6k,dementia,2,,

"Man. That is a good question. I called them out (my piece of shit brother and his 24 year old son, my piece of shit nephew). They of course denied everything. However, the security department at the credit union had me on the phone EVERYTIME they came into the branch and executed a transaction. Video and everything. So our case was solid!

I lined up several witnesses that were prepared to testify the day of the trial on my father and my behalf.

My brother and his asshole son were so stupid that they thought the trial was about them. The judge and my father's lawyer had a meeting with them BEFORE my dad's hearing and had a discussion with them. Not sure what they said, but it worked.

They didn't make a peep during the hearing. They could have objected to anything that was presented. But they kept quiet. Not sure what they said, but it kept them quiet.  When the hearing was over, they were asked to stay after and what we could tell, they were scolded by the judge. 
They left with their tails between their legs. 

People round town (we came from a smallish town) know what losers they are so they are getting what they deserve for sure. If you couldn't guess my brother is an alcoholic and his son is a sociopath. This is not uncommon unfortunately.

I haven't talked to them since they were called out for their lies. Which is understandable. And I won't. Ever. They have been lying to everyone for years... So they ultimately will get what they deserve.

Luckily he has a large family of siblings that keep in relatively good contact with him.

He seems to get something out of social stuff like PD classes and events.  So we try to do those, although some of the classes he tries are a bit much IMO which just adds to his frustration.  Maybe check around for local events?  In AZ we have this: http://duetaz.org/ -- we used to go, but I didn't get anything out of it.

I take supplements to help with my own mental health, and have recently been giving them to my dad too, he seems to be reacting ok to them.  The main ones: D,L-Phenylalanine, Huperzine A, piracetam, ashwaghanda.

"Yes, your visits could be stressing your grandparents. This may not be apparent during the visit, but could affect them later in the day or even the next few days. 

First of all, it can be distressing to a person to be reminded of their short term memory loss.  I can imagine your grandfather was having difficulty remembering your visit earlier in day but really wanted to remember. 

Secondly, there is a term I've used...cognitive fatigue. Your grandparents used a lot of cognitive skills during your visit and while the visit was good, it might also have been fatiguing for them.  This can translate into more confusion end of day even sundowning behavior. 

I think visits are good. But your aunt may need to prepare your grandparents beforehand and support their memory afterwards. While you visit you may like to write them a note as a reminder that you were there and what you discussed with them. Your aunt as primary caregiver may be dealing with some awful after affects of the visit which you might not be aware of and supporting her caregiver role would definitely be helpful.

But yes, on the point of euthanasia I agree entirely. In the past few years in moments of obvious clarity my mom has made several clear attempts at asking to die.

She lives in a nursing home but she's been in the hospital 3 times in the past ten days (she's slept in the nursing home two nights in 10 days) because she keeps having seizures. My dad has to stay with her the whole time she's in the hospital because she will be uncontrollable if she doesn't have someone to anchor her. Why can't we honestly talk about euthanasia?

But the advice is good. I'll play the game and give my Aunt her due respect.

She's in her 60's and doesn't own a home. While visiting this last time my grandfather tells me that they're moving (I had no idea). Which means she'll either move in to their house, or sell it to pay for their care. Not entirely unreasonable. Though the VA will help out some, I know that elderly care can be very expensive. After my last visit I wrote her, telling her that I visited, was told they were moving, and asking where and when. She didn't address any of that, but gently admonished me for visiting unannounced. And that raised my hackles for a few reasons; my Aunt has been oddly controlling as long as I've know her, my relationship with my Grandparent felt threatened, and I'm concerned about her monkeying around with my Grandparent's finances.

"Thirty years ago when I was dealing with my mother's dementia I did an experiment with her. I took the family photo album which I had put together chronologically starting with pics of my parents as children and pics of their families when my parents were young, and showed it to my mom. She recognized everyone—the neighbor she grew up with, her aunts, whose car it was around which the family were all posed, etc. She recognized the pics of my father and their friends when they were still single. When we got to the first portrait of my older sister as a baby (1938) my mother looked at me and said, puzzled, ""You know, I don't know who that is.""

The other thing that befuddled my dad was that when she was still capable of going to church on Sunday (Roman Catholic) she was able to recite the prayers that by that time the congregation said together. That is the opposite of remembering the past more clearly, because almost all of her life the Mass was said in Latin and the congregation did not join in. It was only in the 60s that ""the new Mass"" was introduced, performed in the vernacular, and attendees were encouraged to join in with certain prayers.

"long story short. after my dad's license was revoked, his truck still remained snowed-in during the winter and I took his keys so he COULDN'T drive. This all took place during November - March in the winter of '14-15 in the Northeast. Some of you may know it was a BRUTAL winter last year.

Since i do not live with him, i monitored his phone calls to see what kind of shenanigans he was up to. When I saw that the car dealership had called him, i immediately called them back and talked to the Service Manager. 

I explained who i was and what the situation is. The Manager guy told me he wished that he talked to me 3 hours previous.

"I am 34. 

It does not get easier with age. My mother is 59 as of March and she has FTD. This type of early onset is very hard to cope with, and even professional care givers are surprised when they first face it. This has been going on for about 4-5 years now. 

She should be in a care facility, but my father could not handle the idea of not doing everything he can for her. He will probably die first, which scares me.

It is sad... But it is also the most precious gift. 

Also, best advice I can give is to always show patience. Early onset can be confusing emotionally. My mom cried because I gave her water. She hates water. I asked her instead of she would like some water. She smiled and said ""that would be so nice. Please. ""

Husband does too now, but no diabetes. He had a concussion and a different autoimmune problem. It is the autoimmune apparently that can go into dementia. Yet when I took husband off all sugar, he was binging more and more as he got older, even though earlier he wasn't a sweets person,  his memory has improved and the dementia slide has stabilized. The doctors said that was impossible. ",false,false,t1_cu4tkuk,corbie,,0,1439732494,t5_2rfqf,t3_3h60t7,t3_3h60t7,2,1441282149,0,0,cu4tkuk,dementia,2,,

"First off, you're awesome for stepping up.

Second off, it's probably time to appeal to higher authorities. Possibly begin with sliding scaled based community counselors and/or your local health department. Explain the situation, and include the names and contact info of other family members.

Third, send a group email to the family members include information about [elder abuse.](http://www.aoa.gov/AoA_programs/elder_rights/EA_prevention/whatisEA.aspx) Explain that you cannot do it on your own.

Finally, keep in mind that no - you're not *dying*. As for what you *should* be doing with your life, things like this have a certain karma attached to them. The dementia may be hereditary, and both you and your family members will do best to pool resources.

Best of luck.",false,false,t1_ctqk1ws,TemptThePuffin,,0,1438648814,t5_2rfqf,t3_3fojl4,t3_3fojl4,1,1440264988,0,0,ctqk1ws,dementia,1,,

"From the little I know about dementia, I think your Aunt has a point.  I can also understand how you chaff at being told you need to let her know when you're coming to visit considering that she spent the last decade not seeing your grandparents whereas you've been their closest family member for years and years.   However, she is stepping up now, which is a huge time and emotional commitment and one that alleviates the burden on the rest of the family.  

So, since you live in another state, you normally have to plan the details of your trips to their state in advance, right?   If so, it shouldn't be too much trouble to give your Aunt a ""heads up"" that you're coming and for how long.   

IF, after notifying her, you find that she's obstructing your visits with your grandparents in some way, that'd be a different issue to address.    For now, play the game and see how it goes.

"We had to tweek the meds a bit for him to mellow out. He still has his episodes but they are more manageable for the most part.

Regarding assisted living, that's a tough one. You need to consider guardianship or conservatorship. Can you carry a coherent conversation with him? Does he understand what's going on?

"She's going to hurt herself or someone else. She's too proud, but only because she can't fully comprehend how incapable of driving she is. Nothing about dementia is easy.

"we went through this exact situation with my Dad. we were in agreement that he should not be on the road.
Ultimately, the doctor requested the DMV to re-test him. So my dad received the notice and the date was set. In the meantime, he spun out on a country road on the ice. In the light of that, the Dr. sent a request to the DMV that he should have his license revoked. A couple weeks later, he received the notice that his license was revoked. 

What is the problem with doing something like that?

The longer she is on the road, the greater the risk of her hurting someone else or herself.

Do what you need to do to get her license revoked.

That is not to say that she still wont drive without a license. 

I would 'lose' her keys.

You would not want this on your shoulders if something bad happened.

Best of luck friend.
