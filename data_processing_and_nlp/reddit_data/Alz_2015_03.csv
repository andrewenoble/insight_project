"**The other post in this thread is informative, but by-and-large it's misleading and recommends a lot of self-medication with untested ""natural"" remedies. Use that advice at your own risk. Clinical trials and FDA approval exists for a very good reason.**

What age did your grandparents get the disease at? There are many forms of dementia so ""showing signs"" does not necessarily mean your grandfather had Alzheimer's disease.

If you're grandparents got the disease early-onset (aka 40-60 years of age), then you may be a carrier of a genetic mutation and be at risk for the familial form of the disease. If your grandparents didn't get the disease until later in life (70+) then it was a sporadic case and may mean you have increased risk compared to the general population, but does not mean that you are ""destined to get this disease"". 

Based on the sheer number of individuals on your father's side of the family with the disease, it's likely that they carry the apoE4 allele (for every gene you have, you have 2 copies of it. these are called 'alleles' and they can be different from each other. You get one from each parent), which confers risk of getting Alzheimer's. It's important to remember a few things here:
1.) even if his parents had 2 copies of the allele, your father may have only gotten 1, then, along with your mother, you may not have gotten a single one. (in this scenario you would have no mutations and have the same risk as the general population.)
2.) even if you *did* get 1 or 2 alleles of apoE4 or another Alzheimer's disease risk factor gene, it's still only **risk**, and is in no way a guarantee that you get the disease.

**TL;DR unless both of your parents get Alzheimer's disease in their 50s you are in no way guaranteed to get the disease. Based on your family history it sounds like you're at risk, certainly. Eat healthy and exercise frequently. There is a large connection between heart-health and Alzheimer's disease, so your best bet is to keep your heart healthy and your blood pressure low until we come up with some effective drug therapies for the disease (which the majority of leading scientists in the field of Alzheimer's research think will occur within the next 20 years or so).**

"I'm a little confused. I don't know why a stroke patient would be removed from rehab to an independent living facility; seems like it should go the other way. Also, is your MIL living alone in the family house? Did your SIL wanted you to sell the family house because she wanted to move your MIL close to her geographically, since she's the one who's closest to her?

Anyway, if your MIL needs help and visits, and if you want to do that, I don't see why you shouldn't do it on your own.

"My dad did this exact same stuff toward the end of his life.  We would speak soothingly to him, as if he could respond, but never ask questions.  Sometimes he would mumble gibberish back, but was generally unaware of what was going on around him.  I think he just liked ""chatting"" with us.  Also, soothing and loving touches were calming for him.  We would rub his arm or lightly scratch his head.

He loved messing with shit, so we bought Mega Blocks and set them on the tray in front of him.  He acted like an infant messing with them and threw them everywhere, but he seemed to like having something to mess with even though his motor functions had pretty much tanked.",false,false,t1_cpptypu,thatsidewalkgirl,,0,1427250698,t5_2r8fp,t3_304tj4,t3_304tj4,3,1431997557,0,0,cpptypu,Alzheimers,3,,

"I understand it as those drugs are slowing down the progression even after the damage is done. There is a field of research looking at early detection of the disease, which would be key to treatment. With Alzheimer's there is probably a lot of damage that has been done by the time someone has severe enough memory loss and other symptoms before they get to the doctor and get the diagnosis.
