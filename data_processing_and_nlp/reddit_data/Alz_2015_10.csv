"How much control do you have over keeping your mom in the nursing home? Would your aunt be able to sign off the responsibility to take care of your mom away from the nursing home? If anything happens to your mom, someone will be responsible.

I think your aunt is partially in denial of her sister's Alz condition. My grandma was like your aunt before. She insisted my grandpa who had Alz do things and go places that he really shouldn't be doing/going to.

Also, if your aunt is the type who would talk trash behind your back about your ""cruelty"" to your mom, then there's no point of even keeping in contact with her if she's so negative...

I hope the rest of your family are able to understand the Alzheimer's disease progression in order to understand what you're doing is not cruel.

If your aunt has the rights to take your mom out, then you can't really stop it from happening, but hope for the best. I think your aunt won't be able to handle the caregiving stress after a short while anyways. In no time she would understand the difficulty in caregiving for someone who has Alzheimer's.

That was a bittersweet moment for me.  It was striking and sad because it really drove home the point that she doesn't remember enough to know that she doesn't remember things.  I felt some relief though too, because it meant that when she paces, and re-does laundry, and gets dressed for the day 4x, and tries to eat salad with just a knife, and all of the peculiar things that she does now, that it all seems normal to her, or at least doesn't phase her long-term.

"Well same here with my mom. She doesn't ask to go back at all strangely enough

On some occasions (getting much less frequent now) she'll ask me where she is, but she never seems very distressed about it. More like ""Pisano, where are we?"" or ""Where is this place?"" and actually just yesterday ""What am I doing here? How did I get here?""

When I explain it to her, she seems content. I used to ask sometimes if she remembered our family home and my siblings etc.

She sometimes says yes, but I think she's pretending most times so she won't hurt my feelings (so sweet).

My fear arises from making her feel unsettled if my Aunt does carry her back home. 

I should have mentioned I do sometimes take her for drives and to the mall and she's usually fine. She does seem very lost though, since she's been at that mall ages of times, yet when we went recently, she behaved like it was first time she's ever been there (not stressed, but definitely confused)

This is why I'm afraid of taking her back to her home. Suppose it triggers a bunch of memories and makes her upset, or confused. Or suppose when she gets back to the Nursing home, she wants to leave and go back to her home.

Reddit, in all these last years of caring for her. Seeing her adjust so well to the Nursing home has been almost a miracle for me. 

I'm really really worried and stressed about this and my Aunt is still being a f*cking unrelenting bitch. Even after I explained the situation.

I'm this close to getting a lawyer involved and having the nursing home security forbade her from seeing her. ",,,,Pisano87,,,1445539041,t5_2r8fp,t3_3prph4,t1_cw912lo,2,1447131301,0,0,cw94v2d,Alzheimers,2,,
