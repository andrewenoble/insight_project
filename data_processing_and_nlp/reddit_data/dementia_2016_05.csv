"Florida

The supervisor said something along the lines of, because of his type and stage of dementia, he was able to consent and she wasn't. 

I guess this has to do with the fact that he can walk and talk (although he makes almost no sense). They said that the facility would be liable for assault, if her family were to prosecute, and that he could actually go to jail... It's a messed up situation, because if he were able to consent, he wouldn't be assaulting innocent women.

I read about how FTD is the most troublesome type, because the victims tend to remain mobile and have behavioral issues for a longer time. Because of his personality, I suspected that there would be problems like this.

They just want him out, because he is difficult to manage and takes up too much of their time. I see him getting moved around until he is in the worst place, possible.

"Thank you for your reply and all the info.  After another distressing moment first thing this morning I immediately made my mom another appointment.  This time with my doctor.  

Something I noticed about my doctor versus my mom's doctor is my doctor has her labs in her office and she is very thorough.  I get EKGs at every physical.  My mom's doctor hasn't done an EKG on her ever that I know of.  She sends her patients to Labcorp offsite.  So, yea I was pretty disappointed that she didn't do any tests whatsoever nor recommend a neurologist or anything substantial at her last appointment where I voiced my concern over her memory.  Meanwhile, my doctor has had me going to urologists and nephrologist to chase a microscopic issue which I am very appreciative of her focus.  So, I'm hoping we can get some real answers to my mom's condition.  If nothing else, I know my doctor will do a full panel of tests that I know for a fact my mom hasn't had in years if ever.

"Oh wow. Early onset, and it sounds like she's progressing quickly. Have the doctors ruled out all possible causes like hydrocephalus, untreated thyroid, vit B deficiency?? My grandmother is further along, but she's been on a very slow decline for almost 10 years now. There are so easy answers, and no ""right"" or ""wrong"" when it comes to making decisions like this. What I can offer is my perspective- I think we're around the same age probably, I'm in my mid 20s. 

I'm starting to look at nursing homes for my grandma, and it's not going to be easy to get her placed, for two reasons: she has behavioral issues, and she is/was DETERMINED to stay at home. We've kept her home as long as possible- I did her daily care for 2 years, and hired a live-in about a year ago. I wish I'd moved her into a NH earlier, while there was still a chance she would adjust well. The administrators I've talked to all said that it's best to move them in the earlier stages, that it gets harder to move them during the middle stages, and gets a bit easier again at the very last stage. 

You will have to consider the practical details: who's the main caregiver? Will you be willing/able to help on nights and weekends, if you do move closer? This is a time in your life when you'd be going to school, going out with friends, working, dating. Are you willing to put that on hold for a while? (It doesn't make you a bad person if you say no!!) Dementia has a way of stealing every bit of free time, peace of mind, and energy. 

Speaking about sacrifice- watching a mother go through this, at age 14, is a huge burden. Would your mom be OK with your brother seeing all this? How is he coping? I have a younger sibling a similar age, and I would personally be uncomfortable with her living in Dementia Land- while it's important to learn how to care, love &amp; honor family-  this is a lot to ask.  Realistically, is your dad willing &amp; able to be the primary caregiver? How are their finances? Is he able to hire an aide to come in? That would help ease the workload on him and your brother.  

From what you've said, I wouldn't advise going home or moving in. You'd be putting your life on hold, and while some might say that's selfish, I don't think it is. I also think that unless your Dad is really committed to keeping her at home, and is able to hire some help, you and he should consider looking for placement in memory care or assisted living. I've been down the road of ""keep them home as long as possible,"" and it's really hard. But this is a decision you &amp; dad will have to make. Like I said, there's no right or wrong- there's just making the best decision out of a bunch of really crappy choices, in a godawful situation.

I would recommend you join this forum - it's for a particular strain of dementia called PSP - the symptoms are quite similar in all dementia cases - you can get a lot of help about day-to-day care from here - 
https://healthunlocked.com/psp/posts

The people are super helpful - PSP or CBD are more accurate diagnoses of dementia but they can only be confirmed in the last few months of life (not that it helps) - does you mom have a tendency to fall backwards? Does she have problems turning her gaze downwards? If yes, it might be either of those

Also, you can join this forum and see people's experiences and ask about your own: https://www.facebook.com/groups/psp.warwickshire/

One last thing, did your mom's neuro confirm she doesn't have NPH - that's a condition that has the same signs as dementia - it's tested using a lumbar-puncture, which can be quite painful and it can worsen the dementia for some types of dementia such as PSP or CBD  -but I would recommend asking her neuro

For example, my very independent head strong LO, lectured me on the importance of being with family at Christmas (we had recently decided to stop dragging our kids around the country for holidays).  Since she was in good health and traveled extensively, I invited her to my home for Christmas (to be with family, ya know).  Instead, she accepted an invite from a friend across the country to spend Christmas together.   When I reminded her of her lecture to me and asked why she turned down my invite in order to spend Christmss with her friend, she was dumbfounded and said,""I don't know"".

"I think that it's a little different than you've described.  The terminology in this field is confusing, but let me explain my understanding.  (Page references are to the article.)

About one third of FTD cases are familial.  Page 3.  In this context, ""familial"" means that the patient has genetic mutations in at least one of the known genes associated with expression of the disease.  Page 3.  Those genes include *MAPT*, *progranulin*, and *C9ORF72*.  Pages 7-8.  There might be mutations in other genes, but those are quite rare.  Page 8.  

The remainder of cases are called ""sporadic"" - meaning that they have no known cause.  Page 3.  It doesn't refer to any sporadic timing of symptoms.  

In light of this, FTD doesn't switch from being familial to being sporadic.  It's either genetic (~30% of cases) or not (the rest).  

Like you, I'd like to get the genetic testing.  From what I've learned talking with people in the biz, it appears that the first step is getting the diagnosed patient tested to see what (if any) genes contain mutations.  That way, the later genetic tests on relatives can just focus on those genes, or further genetic tests can be skipped if it's not genetic.  I am going to figure out how to get testing and how much it costs.

"Well, to start off, it sounds like you're doing a great job. You're dealing with a very tough situation, and somehow you're making it work - but it sounds like it isn't going to work for much longer.

You may want to look into some ways to get you a little respite. I don't know where you live, but look into adult day programs - I'm guessing that if your mom was out of your hair for even a day or two every week, it would probably help you a great deal. Day programs are what they sound like - kind of like a daycare, but for adults who are not so bad they need a care home, but still need more attention/stimulus/supervision than they can get at home. And while it seems like you have some reluctance about putting your mom into care, looking into your options earlier rather than later can be helpful to get her placed in a good home at the appropriate time. Lots of places have waiting lists, especially good ones. 

And like I started off, it sounds like you've taken on a LOT. Her dementia is certainly progressing, and you're absolutely right about her physical decline following the cognitive decline.

Thanks for your question and sorry for the delay in my response. 

Question 1. ""The person needs to remember to wear them"". I often get asked this question. Our research from speaking to carers in the field is that people with the disease often have very limited shoes often one or two pairs. So we feel confident that our device will be in the right place at the right time. 

Question 2. How will they be charged? Another great question, we are actually wanting to design our own large wireless charging pad. We have several smart features we hope to implement. One is having large charging coils to allow for large charging zones. Our hope is that the person can simply have this charging pad where they would normally put their shoes and just place their shoes on their. Our aim is to have the insoles charging inside the shoes.

"I'd say you need to see another doctor...

Of the various things you mentioned, the repetitive questions about her ankle is, to me, the most clearly not the forgetfulness of ""Well, she is getting a little older"".  (With my mom, there was the day we had the exact same comversation every 2 minutes for 20-25 minutes - ""Are you going out?"" ... ""Oh, that's nice, where?"" ... ""Are you driving?"" ... "" Oh! They have a shuttle now?!"" ... ""Well, that's nice of them, isn't it?"")

But it's also true that a variety of plain old medical conditions can bring on dementia like behavior in older people.  Three examples I can think of off the top of my head are undiagnosed depression, dehydration and bladder infections.  (It came as quite a surprise to me, but apparently it's possible for an older person to have a bladder infection without having any discomfort!)

So, if this hasn't been done already, it seems like it would be a good idea to get a complete physical (with the ***new*** doctor!)

One thought I have is try to keep a log of these memory, self-care, and changing personality behaviors.  Try to be as matter of fact as possible, just make a note of what she did, and what the circumstances were.  The goal is to build up a catalog of the suspect behaviors, so when you next go to the doctor, you'll have the full range of her behaviors at your finger tips.

Also, I don't think there's anything to be gained in looking for connections between current behaviors and traumas of her past, except insofar as, having had such an awful childhood, she very well *might* have undiagnosed depression.  

But, if she has dementia from Alzheimer's or Fronto Temporal or some such, any resemblance between her past and her current issues is best thought of as purely coincidental.

Those conditions are physical, pure and simple.  The brain is being damaged, and just like any other kind of brain damage, the resulting behavior comes from the area of the brain that is damaged, not from any personal response to past events.

The main reason, in my book, for keeping that distinction in mind is that we think of behavior that comes from the effects of the past as something that can be fixed.  But trying to fix the behavior that comes from dementia is really just pointless torture for the caregiver and for the patient.

As an example, people can be paralyzed by an accident, severing the spinal cord.  People can also be psychosomatically paralyzed, through some emotionally traumatic event.

Psychosomatic paralysis can be fixed, accident paralysis can't.

I think we can all see how cruel it would be for all concerned to try to fix paralysis that comes from an accident.

It's pretty much the same thing with dementia.  And looking for, seeing connection with her past can create a huge temptation to try to fix it, making life harder for both of you...

Don't know if you're aware of the [Alzheimer's Organization](http://www.alz.org/), but they have lots of resources on their web site, and I believe you can even call to ask for help finding local organizations within reach of where you live.

"It's a huge issue with dementia patients. The whole showering and changing clothing. They also love sleeping in their clothing. I quit the pajamas wars and just let them as far as the people I cared for. For her health and comfort she needs to at least be putting on fresh underwear everyday though. In your place, I would consider getting a home health aide to come in mornings to do the showering and dressing with her. As your mother, she is naturally more embarrassed in front of you, and as also more able to ""game"" you into getting what she wants (stay in the same dirty clothing, not shower). They don't like showering and changing for various reasons. One major one is that they are forgetting how to do it (this is the stage where they usually also forget to properly wipe themselves after toileting as well).

"London dementia specialist here

There are a range of tests though it really depends on what you want to achieve?

Do you want to screen for dementia or do you want to produce memory exercises as they are quite different things. So far there is little in terms of memory exercise apps and the latest evidence is that's only effective media based tools are are those that have an assistant. You would probably be better with an exercise app as that is the biggest predictor of progression.

The traditional cognitive tests also suffer from repetition effects and we rarely retest more than six monthly as there are learning biases.

The main tests we use are 

Ace3 though you need to be an English speaker, literate and educated to the age of 16.

MOCA faster and better for frontal changes

RUDAS bit of a blunt instrument but easily used for those who are illiterate or do not have English as a first language with an interpreter present.

We also use Basoll as an OT screen 

Our neuropsychologist uses much more specialist tools but that can take an hour or more to administer

IMHO, what your mother is doing is unfair.  That being said, you do have control over the situation.   Stopping her from guilting/tricking/forcing you into going to see him may be extremely unpleasant.  It might lead to substantial fights or uncomfortable situations with her.  That being said, you should ask yourself which is more uncomfortable - the situation arising from your refusal to go or the continued harassment.  Again, you do have control over this, as unpleasant as the ramifications might be.  

If she needs proof of it to believe you, then perhaps you can record it on your phone?

So there are some pretty significant difficulties with diagnosis and use of these tests. None are 100% and all that they really do is back up the clinical history taking and observation in the home.

The numbers can change dramatically depending on the education level of the patient and doing the same test on a repeated number of times will show improvement in that task but just that task. 

I did have the idea of producing a game that monitors cognitive performance by asking the person to do tasks  then alert you or your doctor if performance falls. Problem of 'stickiness' then arises, no one plays the game!

"I don't think you're terrible to think this way. My grandfather didn't have dementia, but he definitely had pretty terrible memory by the end of it (died at 96, iirc). The thing with him was that his body gave out before his mind did, which may be worse, depending who you are. It was really hard watching him go down—a similar figure to your grandma, always at things, only close family member outside of immediate family. I definitely felt a kind of relief when he finally passed, though it was from pneumonia, so not as painless as one would hope (though it was fairly quick). It was hard watching him go and watching the way my family had to handle it for the last few years. I don't think you should feel ashamed for feeling this way at all. It's not easy dealing with this sort of slow death, which is in many ways a sort of sequence of deaths, especially when memory is involved. I think the relief I felt was largely based on the fact that, to me, my grandfather had died years before he died, when he had lost his ability to work (he was operating a tractor until he was 86), go on walks, or simply take care of himself (which was incredibly important to him. As an anecdote, while I did some nursing help for him, he'd often, when I asked him if he needed anything, he himself would say ""a gun""). It's an absolute shit situation, and dementia is a fucking bitch, as you say (and I think it's fine to say that, nobody here would disagree with you).

"That's awesome!

One additional tidbit - Getting to sleep and/or staying asleep seems to be par for the course after menopause.

To get enough sleep, I take 

* melatonin, 
* L-tryptophan, 
* L-theanine, and 
* magnesium 

every night before bed.

I also used to take benadryl, but recently I came across [**this article**](http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/common-anticholinergic-drugs-like-benadryl-linked-increased-dementia-risk-201501287667) reporting on a study that concluded benadryl use increases risk of dementia, so I gave it up.

"This is a great idea, especially if its only mild dementia.  It will be less frustrating and more helpful to both of you.  I've read that reminiscing about the past is great for people with dementia.  And once you have some info, you can ask for details later or just ask some of the ones she was fired up about more later.  It will give you something to connect with her on.  My dad loves to look at old pictures. He is slowly forgetting who some people are but sometimes he'll suddenly remember or remember something 10 minutes or so after I ask.  Great idea!

"I'm a geriatric psychologist from the Netherlands. We use different tools. For example:

For screening:

* Visual Association Test (VAT) Implicite visual learning test for the recognition of retrograde amnesia
* Further: Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Cognitive Screening Tool (CST), MOCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), CAMCOG (Cambridge Cognitive Examination)


More specific tools:

* 8WT or 15WT: 8 of 15 woordenleertaak which translates as wordlearning task
* BADS: Behavioural Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndroms, for executive functioning
* ADS6: Amsterdam Dementia Screening test 
* Complex Rey Figure for visuospatial functioning, strategic planning and memory
* EMCT: Expanded Mental Controle Test for Attention and mental flexibility
* TMT: Trail Making Test also for attention and mental flexibility

This is just a small selection of tools we use in our work. Also: the selection of tests you want to use is often dependent on the cognitive functioning of the patient (and often the type of dementia or brain damage)

EDIT: Also, These tests don't give a 100% certainty about the presence of a neurodegenerative syndrom. Results should be interpreted with a clinical and experienced eye.

"This is all learning as you go along. Since you said it's moderate, I'll offer what I seemed to have gleaned from my mom, who has it mild to moderate, which is that, while specific details and recollections don't seem to stick, overall impressions can gain traction. What this *seems* to be the case with my mom is that she won't recall specific occurrences, but she'll have a hazy sense that certain things have a tendancy to happen in regard to a certain circumstance. For my mom, it has to do with things like being reminded to conserve water (we're in California) or always being relieved of the duty of putting the dishes and plates away since she'll put them in the wrong places or chip them because she's not careful. In these cases, she'll get annoyed if I bring these up in the wrong way that implies that she's at fault, so I try to portray it as that I'm doing her a favor by doing it for her or she's doing me a favor by allowing me to act accordingly. If you're done you're done, but if you decide to give another go, try to white-lie and phrase things as if it's because of your shortcomings. For example, regarding the bathroom door, you could try phrasing it such that the door needs fixing because it doesn't close properly, which you need to get around to repairing, and 'remind' her of that by saying that she needs to take extra care in closing it.",,,,argyle47,,,1462270898,t5_2rfqf,t3_4hkel7,t3_4hkel7,3,1465601394,0,0,d2qubya,dementia,3,,

"Instinct will be your best guide. Realistically, unless his breathing, circulation, heart or mobility are noticeably impaired, it can wait a day or two.

"I went through this with my dad. Eventually I had to just say to him, dad I'm worried about your memory. He has gone back and forth about agreeing with me and saying he's fine but he's definitely changing. Mom wouldn't acknowledge it either, until recently.

What I would recommend is having your dad talk to her first. She might be in denial but if you both sit her down or the family does it will likely be more overwhelming and she may become more upset or feel attacked.
I agree with the other comment about framing it in a life planning sense. When my dad would shut the subject down I'd let it go but always made sure I verbally expressed ""Fine we don't have to talk about this if you really don't want to. But, ignoring it isn't going to make it go away, and getting medical attention is always better to do earlier than later.""

"Just returned from the doctor with my mom. I'm so glad I heeded your advice to get another opinion. Learned my mom's medications were horribly prescribed. She was taking too many water pills which resulted in her being taking too many potassium pills. And. Most importantly. She was prescribed too many sedatives. Her doctor prescribed that she take 3 high dose lorazepam per day! Luckily, I was suspicious of this and only gave her 2 per day but even that was too much, causing her to sleep all day and be confused when she was awake. So my doctor (her new doctor) is weaning her off slowly with the plan of needing only 1/2 a pill IF she has a problem going to sleep at night. So hopefully/prayerfully my mom can regain her memory and energy. The appointment was very thorough and I feel so much better hearing my concern was validated.

"I genuinely feel my mother does have a form of dementia.  I made an appointment with her physician and she (the doctor) downplayed the issue stating simply ""well we all forget things"".  But it's more than that, she (my mother) as you stated, can't remember one thing from one moment to the next.  Hyperfocuses on random things and repeats nonsensical things.  One of her latest focuses has been on a sore on her ankle.  I've made an appointment with her dermatologist about the issue and they are going to be treating it in a few weeks (it's not urgent), I've informed her of this but I can count on her coming to me every day, turning her leg sideways and showing me her ankle.  She asks at least 2 times a day should she put salt water on it or what she should put on it. Things she's used to controlling/managing she asks me about constantly (ex., she pays $20 per week to the church on her tithe for years, she's asked me how much she is supposed to pay recently). She'll say she's cold but nothing in her mind tells her to put on pants instead of the thin housedress she puts on everyday. I tell her to put on pants and she does it (something she would know to do on her own always in the past if she were cold).  She eats anything and everything, so I have to control what food is easily accessible to her to keep her from eating all the food in the house at one time. She's terrified of the weather.  She sleeps all day so she can't sleep at night and wants sleeping pills which I control her access to (she was taking way too many at one time).  If I try to go out to dinner with friends, she gets distressed.  God forbid I try to go on vacation, the last trip I went on was a business trip for my company a year ago and she showed so much distress I couldn't focus on the trip I was on (the day I was leaving she suddenly forgot if she'd taken her medication for the day, come to find out she'd put her daily dosage in her purse for some reason).  She lost her glasses, I found them in her restroom where she was putting on her wig.  She lost the bottom half of her dentures, only God knows where that ended up, I suspect the septic tank; had to fork out $500 to get replacement for that.  She's left the stove top on once, thank God I was home when that happened.

I sit sometimes and try to figure out what in the world happened to my mom. She was never totally independent, but she was more self sufficient than she is now for sure. It's like she's reverting to some weird childhood she never had. Her mom (my grandmother) died in childbirth so she and her siblings were raised by a cruel aunt who wouldn't feed them but once per week.  So she never got love and attention.  So it's like she's going back to that time and wants constant attention and reassurance. And the food issue seems to stem from the lack of food she endured as a child.  I may be reading too much into it, but it just FEELS like that's what I'm seeing.  Anyway, back to the doctor.  She just thinks it's NORMAL since my mom is 85.  How is any of this normal? Am I being too much of an alarmist?!? It's so frustrating and lonely watching all of this happening.",,,,babygirlga,,,1463952627,t5_2rfqf,t3_4ki8mv,t3_4ki8mv,1,1466028665,0,0,d3fluxk,dementia,1,,
