"All theses suggestions are wonderful. I have been a private caregiver as well as a caregiver for my mom who presently suffers with Alzheimer's. 

First of all, you are a very brave and super young women for moving back in with your mother to help care for your grandmother. I'm sure you have realized by now, until you actually are an Alz. caregiver, there is no way you can understand the depth of this extremely difficult and overwhelming job. It is the most physically, mentally, and emotionally draining job, I have ever done. That's why I firmly believe, that you cannot be what a person with Alzheimer's needs unless you can take care of yourself. You already work at a job and go to school. For your sake and your grandmothers sake, see if there is any way that your mom can have a/the caregiver come in at 7:00 am when your she leaves for work. On you days off, be the caregiver your grandmother needs you to be. Get up when she gets up. Nap when she naps. Keep her engaged. Make her meals, Eat with her. Talk with her. Take her outside. Take her on errands with you (if she's able). Go shopping (if and for how long she is able). 

You are 24 years old. You need to work your job, you need to go to school, you need to study, you need a social life, and you need to take care of yourself!

"My mom also has Alzheimer's, and both of the replies (before mine) are excellent. I would Google - digital large display clocks with a record voice reminders feature, and start from there. Also call your local Alzheimer's association or your local Council on Ageing, and maybe they will know of a device that would be helpful to your mom. 

If for some reason you cannot find exactly what you are looking for, tell the managers, supervisors, and staff at your moms assisted living facility to be her reminders. If and when she shows and interest in an activity or event, ask them nicely to be your moms reminders, and hold them to it.

"We got a cheap buzzer at Walmart for the doors. It sticks on and you can set it to either off, alarm or chime when the door is opened. We use chime during the day, so I can tell if my loved one is going outside, and alarm at night so it will wake me up. You could do that for the bedroom door, or even just put a noisy bell on the door. Baby monitors are cheap, if your loved one doesn't move things around too much- maybe hide it under the bed. 

Consider night lights to light the way to the bathroom (maybe a string of Christmas lights), a strip of rough tape leading from the bedroom to bathroom (there is tape that's rough like sandpaper on one side), removing the toilet lid and replacing the seat with a different colored one (not black), removing the waste basket, AND perhaps the best is a bedside commode (reduces opportunity for falls, mess, and wandering). A basket with wipes (throw them out, don't use flushable! It clogs up eventually), gloves, and whatever else you might need, should be kept right next to the toilet in easy reach for the carer. 

Beyond that... Don't stress about the mess. They're not doing it on purpose. Clean it up and move on. OdoBan is a gift from the gods- I buy it in gallon size from walmart and add it to all laundry, especially soiled with poop/pee. Plain white vinegar is a wonderful cleaner and deodorizer.

"Unless you get a brain scan well before any symptoms present themselves, at this point in time, we truly do not have a way of detecting Alzheimer's early. All the information I have studied says that once symptoms start presenting themselves, the person is usually already at the end of the early stage. And then, most diagnosis takes so long that they can be in the beginning of the moderate stage by the time they are actually diagnosed. This has been my experience as a caregiver.

We know when most people start having symptoms,  they will hide as well as deny to themselves and others that they are experiencing problems. I believe, until we can find ways for quicker diagnosis, much better treatments to either slow the progression of the disease to such a degree a person would have a better chance of dying from other causes, or to cure the disease altogether, maybe in the early stages such as we do now with a lot of cancers, there is not going to be an incentive for a person to get an early diagnosis.

"I have spent time with many elderly people. I have provided caregiving for Alzheimer's/Dementia patients. Besides loosing some abilities to perform normal self care, one of the first symptoms I will usually notice is Asking the same questions over and over. 

I have seen many elderly try and hide the fact that they are having difficulties. But, they will ask the same question, or even repeat the same thought/comment over and over again, because they cannot remember ever asking the question or making the comment before. This is a HUGE RED FLAG.

I have also seen many, many families deny to themselves that their parent or loved one may have Alzheimer's and thus will put off providing them with the appropriate care needed until an accident happens. I believe denial among the family is almost as epidemic as dementia itself. This to is SO SAD. 

Moreover, a lot of adults that have parents or loved ones with visible signs of dementia will put off getting the appropriate care because the parent or loved on is fighting against that possibility, and do not believe they are having enough difficulty to accept outside help. If this happens, it is So IMPORTANT that the child (or now the adult child) becomes the PARENT. It can be very difficult to become the parent of your parent. But you must. And, you must make some decisions that your parent or loved one may not like. Of course, be a very gentle parent to your parent, but do whatever you have to do to get them on board. Tell them it's only for a few days or a couple weeks.

My mother began calling my sister and me at work several times a day. She resisted in-home care. We told her we worried about her during the day while we were working, and we needed not to worry about her while we were working. She reluctantly agreed. Within three weeks she thought is was one of the best decisions SHE ever made.

"My mom's early symptoms included confusing television shows with her life story, ie she'd integrate something she'd seen as something that happened to her. She also repeated the same sentence over and over and over - not a question, but a statement, as if she hadn't told me before.
She also started a 'journal' and wrote things down, like what she ate or when she took her medications, so she wouldn't forget.
She got a pill box, for a week's worth of meds, so she'd always know where she was.
She wanted people to go to the doctor or shopping or whatever with her.
She stopped coming to stay overnight with her kids. We all live in the same city and have taken turns having mom over for the weekend, the holidays, whatever.  In the beginning, she no longer wanted to sleep over, then she no longer wanted to come over.  (I now know this is because she felt safer in her own home and her own environment.)
She also reverted to some really, really old behavior, like reusing her wash water for her hands and face. (She was raised on a farm and well water was never wasted.)
More frequent confusion of words or forgetting of specific words.
Stopping activities she loved - crocheting, quilting, sewing - because she said she was sick of them. But in fact, she'd forgotten how to do them.
Collecting odd things - mom collected pictures of animals used in print ads by one of the phone services.
Pre-preparing meals way too early and then serving them heated from the microwave or cold because she can no longer plan and sequence things. This leads to not eating properly.

the list goes on and on. The big lesson I had to learn was to identify what was unusual with my mother, because while AD patients have many similarities, they also have many many unique manifestations of the illness, especially at the beginning.

The number one thing is to set up a network of people. They can be old coworkers, his friends, her friends, family members, church members, neighbors, paid caregivers, who knows maybe boy scouts that need a badge, to give respite care. This can be sitting with them and chatting while you do laundry in the other room, taking them for icecream, letting you go to the doctor yourself, run errands, or just sit with them while you bang you head against the wall. Set them up before you need them, I have one person stop by once a week at least. I try to make it be around the same day/time so I can plan to take ""me time"" while they are there. This week I went for a massage, last week I took a nap. If you don't take care of yourself you will snap. 


Bed alarms are great! They also make matts you can sneak under the carpet by the front door to prevent wandering. 

I find making my day easier gives me more time to care properly which in turn makes my day easier! I do this by automating things when I can. I use one of these so I only have to sort pills once a week and can't forget a dose because of a minor catastrophe.

I love this help button!!!!!
LogicMark Freedom Alert Emergency Alert System -https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002IMW8O4/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awd_ekKAwbHQ5JNY6

It works like a cordless home phone and has to be connected to a landline. You don't pay a monitor fee like most. You program it to call 4 numbers in order and then can choose to have it call 911 if the 4 people don't answer. I have it call me twice and the hired caregiver twice. When you answer it tells you it's and emergency and asks you to accept the call by pressing 5 so it isn't tricked by voicemail. It reaches way further than expected and you can speak to them through a mic and speaker in the button!

I also have to say that YouTube and Netflix are good too. Is he reminiscing about a certain time period? Pull up YouTube and find a documentary or news reel. Pull up Netflix and find an old film! Also for some reason my household can watch Simons cat animations for hours just laughing. 

I put an iPad mounted to the wall by his bed. The tv was too hard for him to use and he lost the remote constantly , but you can lock a iPad into ""guided access"" meaning it won't do anything but the app it's in when you start it. I lock it in Netflix and start a movie at bedtime and he happily goes to bed instead of complaining he is not tired (even though he was just snoring in his chair). He can use it easily because you just tap the movie you want to watch.  (He just chooses from the few he can see on the screen as he's not great at navigating) 

In another way to make my day easier I got a automatic pet feeder and pay to have groceries delivered (thanks Safeway!) I use the app for my pharmacy to help me keep track of refills.

"Hi.  I work in a neurology dept.  We have an Alzheimer's prevention clinic.  Part of my job is to read  the medical literature on a daily basis to ensure we stay current.  Large studies show (check out David Bennetts work at Rush Hospital Chicago) that brains of people with genetic predisposition (apoE 4/4) often have normal cognition until death even though they are riddled with amyloid and tau, and people without apoE 4 can have cognitive decline.  Genes may only account for 1/3rd of cases.  The rest is based on modifiable factors (early menopause without estrogen replacement, mid life obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, concussion, depression, standard American diet, lack of exercise).  Near daily strenuous exercise (just get the heart rate up!) and adopting the Mediterranean diet (vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, white meat, 4 tbl olive oil a day, fish 3-4 times a week, way less white bread, way less red meat, coffee, dark chocolate, red wine) can cut your risk by at least 50%.  The way most of us eat leads to a state of chronic inflammation. At your age you have plenty of time to alter your genetic ""destiny"".  Also... Learn a new language, a new skill, a new instrument.  And stay mindful... Try to keep your mind on the task you're doing instead of thinking about other things.  Listen intently to others.  If you want more information... Email me at amfwork@gmail.com.

"Had to get my mom on SSDI about two or three years ago. I don't remember much but for whatever it's worth... 

So we live in Texas. My mom was 54 at the time. She got laid off so I applied online for SSDI and just waited for phone calls. I think it took a few weeks but first phone call was to inform me that I needed to take her to get her tested. So took her there and she failed pretty bad. Simple math, adding subtracting money, remembering sentences words. There's a name for the test but my memory sucks. 

I applied for Medicaid (I think that was an option while applying for SSDI) but she got denied due to her assets. Too young for Medicare also (more on that later). Thank you Obamacare. 

It took a few months but she was eventually approved and the money started getting deposited. What a damn lifesaver. This wasn't a difficult process at all. 

Fast forward a few years. I had to put my mom in a personal care home. While you're early in this process, PLEASE get power of attorney taken care of. I waited too long, my mom got much worse and I had to take the guardianship route, which took around 9 months and thousands of dollars for a lawyer. This entire time, I was paying 3k a month (out of my own pocket) for her personal care home and this was the most brutal part. Sorry if I'm digressing but this condition is unpredictable, so prepare for the worst. 

And I have no idea what happened but my mom qualified for Medicare this year. She just turned 57 and qualified on her birthday month. ",,,,uncex3,,,1450373166,t5_2r8fp,t3_3x5vqd,t3_3x5vqd,1,1451701545,0,0,cy2egzs,Alzheimers,1,,

"Exactly, stage 4 or even 4/5 is usually when most people are diagnosed. This is beyond sad. When you do finally take someone in for a diagnosis, for some it has taken close to a year for a diagnosis. This is totally unacceptable. 

I realize there are a lot of people that do not feel this way, but from what I have seen an experienced, the drugs used today to delay the progression of the disease are just ""Hope in a Bottle."" Why would you want to live with moderate to severe Alz. for a longer period of time? That's all these drugs are doing. By the time the disease has progressed to the moderate stages, your mind had deteriorated to the point where you are completely dependent upon others for your existence. Not to mention the hardship for the family's and the outrageous cost of care. 

As humans, we are conditioned to prolong human life as long as possible. We would rather see our loved ones suffer through this disgusting, undignified, protracted disease than let then go through the stages more quickly. Sometimes it seem like the families are thinking more of themselves, when agreeing to letting their loved one take these drugs. We treat our animals better than humans.

"I have read a lot of information about memory exercises to help PREVENT Alzheimer's. But no concrete proof. I've known and worked with many Alzheimer's patients and many had advanced degrees, were socially active, were in Bridge clubs and were involved in all types of activities. They were already doing the types of things some scientist are studying as possible preventions. My mother has Alzheimer's and she was very active in clubs, charities, and did crossword puzzles (for as long as I have know her), word search games, words scrambles. She has always been healthy except for a ruptured disk in her lower back many years ago, some nasal allergies. No heart problems. Never overweight. The only thing I can think that may have put her at risk, is she has had progressive hearing loss for many years. Even though all her children, grandchildren and doctors would talk to her about getting hearing aides. She never would and used every excuse in the book. I believe her untreated progressive hearing loss is what put my mom at high risk for Alzheimer's.

Sorry for the ramble. To answer you question, I have not seen anything about doing memory exercises to delay the progression of Alzheimer's. The only thing I know that works, at this time, is medication. I'm not saying you should not do your own research and do the memory exercises, but I have not seen anything to support that doing memory exercises, once there has already been a diagnoses of Alzheimer's, will slow the progression. 

If you know of someone with early stage Alzheimer's, keep them active as long as possible. If this person does not have a family member to who can help them stay active on a daily basis.

"Remember that the AD sufferer will at some stage forget know how to get to the toilet and later, how to turn their body so as to sit on the toilet, how to wipe themselves clean, how to pull the chain, how to pull the toilet paper off the roll, how open their hand so the used toilet paper drops into the toilet, etc - so the problems and solutions related to toilet use and pooing are ever changing, usually for the worse. So, make sure you are never too lazy to put your thinking cap on, because not putting it on is so much worse not only for the AD sufferer, but for you too. Here are some solutions I've had to come up with that may help others: 

Kiddy locks, those ones that stop kids opening and shutting the toilet lid - Stops the AD sufferer from putting things in the toilet

Balancing something precariously on the cistern lid - stops the AD sufferer lifting and fiddling in the cistern, or putting dirty toilet paper etc in there, because as soon as they start fiddling the object crashes to the ground, stopping them and warning the carer there is a problem

Take the key out of their toilet door - can't lock themselves in

Attach a length of elastic, threaded with things that jingle, between the door and doorjam - you can hear when they try to open the door to go to the loo unattended

Use adult diapers - stops the big and dreadful mess

At night use adult diapers with a catsuit put on backwards so it cannot be taken off - stops night poos all over the place, and the catsuit stops the AD sufferer from removing the diaper

Keep a special purpose hygiene mop and bucket in the bathroom - use the mop to mop down the person when you get them in the bath to clean up after they have messed themselves, and then use it to mop out the bath, and then rinse and disinfect the mop ready for next time

If the person begins to look or behave with more agitation than usual, don't get tired of ask the basic questions (whether they need the toilet, are thirsty, in pain, hungry or tired) - stops many toilet related accidents :)

Diarise each and every poo for a while to see if there is a pattern in relation to eating - lets you institute a meal plan that suits when you can be there to attend to toilet-going. 

Work out a schedule of assisting the person to the toilet - maybe every couple of hours, and immediately on waking, and last thing at night

Always keep Imodium on hand and treat diarrhea as soon as it makes itself know - saves a lot a lot of issues

Always (always!) check out the floor where you are walking - never know when you will come across some poo. 

Stick soiled clothes, blankets etc in the washing machine and get the wash going as soon as you can even if it is the middle of the night - because there is not much worse than coming back later or the next morning to a poo cleanup half done!

An AD sufferer's behaviour around toilets is ever changing but doing the bad things (like insisting on breaking up the poo with their hands because they've forgotten how to pull the chain) does eventually pass. So don't give up hope :)

"Haha, I understand completely! Trust me, I am very familiar with the combo of stubborn + dementia. :) 

If she's refusing or forgetting to take meds, she does need more/different care-- I think a hospital evaluation and placement is a good step. Don't expect that this is the end of the road, though- many people have a very difficult adjustment to 24/7 care. If she does stay in a dementia unit/nursing home, one way you can ease the transition is to say that ""you can go home once you're healed and the doctor approves it."" Most will be agitated and demand to go home, but framing her stay there as a medical necessity may help. After some time, she might stop asking to go home. 

 The good news is that with UTIs, once the infection has been dealt with, there is often a slight improvement in behavioral issues- the UTI definitely temporarily exacerbates symptoms.
