We thought that she should stay home because thats what she had wanted before the disease. But she has always been social, and once the disease took hold, her needs weren't the same. She wasn't living in the same world as she was before and once we accepted that, and catered to her new world, things became so much easier.

"First off, thank you. I always want to be with my grandma but for the time when I can't be, it's so comforting to know there are a few people out there who show love to them when we can't be there. 

But to your question, my grandma enjoys magazines, even if they aren't something she is too interested in. She can't really read anymore, but looking at the pictures and flipping through the pages seems to soothe her. Also it's a very casual activity and so it doesn't feel like work to her like coloring occasionally can (sometimes she thinks it's a form to complete or something, and can get easily exhausted). 

I think that a photo book or documentary of different plants and animals would be fantastic like other people have suggested. If she likes dogs or cats, the show Too Cute! is a good one as it has soothing music and narration and very adorable animals and doesn't require any following of a plot. 

Perhaps tending to even fake flowers could calm her? I know my grandma likes talking about her beautiful window garden, and even though the flowers aren't real it doesn't seem to bother her.

What these types of treatments do is improve certain aspects of memory such as object recognition, social recognition (including face recognition), name recall, repetitive memory, and place memory. There is also greater awareness and alertness, fewer delusions, and better sleep.  More intricate forms of memory involving other parts of the brain in addition to the hippocampus are less prone to improvement--this includes ability to remember short-term events and the ability to make sense.  The latter may involve damage to the frontal cortex which helps in sorting out information.  My mother's memory improved in the first areas listed above substantially with aromatherapy but she became only slightly better with ""event memory"" and with lucidity.  She could not sort out information in her brain so her comments often seemed random and difficult to follow.",,,,Lane_Simonian,,,1464230631,t5_2r8fp,t3_4l21bs,t3_4l21bs,0,1466103733,0,0,d3jyatk,Alzheimers,0,,

For my mother who had Alzheimer's disease for eight years before she died of unrelated causes, my sisters and I had her smell a few essential oils (such as rosemary, clove, bay laurel, and orange) for a few seconds each morning.  She recognized her home again, slept better, recognized certain objects (such as a rose and sugar), could remember her name again and spell it, counted numbers, recited the alphabet, and was much more alert and aware.  She had difficulties remembering short-term events and sorting out information (which made her seem to be random in what she said), but she improved slightly in these last two area as well.

The unfortunate part is there are no magic answers. I'm in my 70's and taking care of my spouse with AD and the best advice I'm received so far is that when the person is not acting like I feel they should (or like they used to), it is not them, it is the disease coming out. That has helped me to keep the situations in a separate compartment.

I've also learned to try to focus on issues of gratitude. In your case, your grandpa has taken care of and raised a wonderful daughter (your mother). Be grateful of that. He took care of her in her formative years, now it's a bit of payback.....that's OK. The value in life is sharing and making others happy.

As for making your mom feel comfortable about it, it seems to me that everyone experiences Alzheimer's differently. My husband didn't realize that he had it and we never mentioned it. His decline was very slow so it was easy to gloss over his loss of abilities one by one in very small steps. What might at first seem horrifying — like having to shave him or take off his socks for him — turns out to feel like normal routine when there's a long transition and when you go about it matter-of-factly.

Help your mom to save face whenever possible. I remember telling my husband, ""Gosh those new socks are so tight, a person needs help getting them off...""
