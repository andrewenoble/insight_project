"I read your update, encourage your mom to keep having care plan neetings with the nurse. It will help decrease feelings of anger, provide answers, and open communication. In my state, it is mandatory to weigh residents monthly and if they have a significant weight loss over a couple of months (5+ pounds), there has to be a care plan meeting. So I don't love the fact that the facility never put that in place. There are diets and special shakes she can drink- ensure and mighty shakes are an easy doctors order away. If your mom or someone can- observe her eating a meal. Staff are also supposed to track whether or not residents eat (memory care assisted living at least and skilled I think you have to record percentage of how much they ate) she could benefit from speech therapy if she is having trouble getting food to her mouth or a puree chopped or finger food diet to make self of assisted feeding easier.

My point being, we have tried every avenue that we can think of and more.

It definitely sounds like he needs testing.  Do you know:  has he ever experienced traumatic brain injury?

_____
I have had so many positive experiences with music for my 90 year old grandma! She can't remember anything for half a minute, but she still remembers the melodies (and sometimes even words) to certain songs from her youth. When those songs play, she often hums / sings along and is generally happy, peaceful, and distracted, focused on the music. Her joy is even greater when I sing along with her, it makes her laugh so happily. And awesomely enough, I can even go away for a few minutes to fix something without her worrying or following me as she usually would, I just hear her humming happily from the other room.

We built her a ""music button"" a few months ago so she can at least sometimes listen to music even when we are not there: We attached a light switch to the table, wrote ""MUSIC"" on it and ""ON"" and ""OFF"" on the respective sides, so that when she comes into her kitchen and inspects the button, she sometimes manages to turn on music by herself for herself. Pic: https://www.dropbox.com/s/kmn5fv81593h06d/20151020_161132.jpg

We built the button by buying a simple bulky on-off light switch and hooking it to a raspberry pi, a cheap tiny computer that you can easily program to do what you want when the electricity is turned on. We filled it with 20-30 songs we know she recognises and likes and those just start playing via the connected audio boxes whenever she presses the button. Total cost around 100€ including cheap audio boxes.

Finding songs she recognises was also relatively easy: I digitalised old cds she had lying around, searched online for songs from old cassettes, and just generally played a lot of oldie and classical stuff from her youth times from youtube. If she didn't recognise a song she just didn't really react at all and we talked about the same things as always, if she did recognise them she just sort of lit up and sometimes started humming or asking what that song was called while it played.",,,,Seriouslyfatcat,,,1460457517,t5_2rfqf,t3_4dxt4u,t3_4dxt4u,1,1463386662,0,0,d1zmsz6,dementia,1,,

"Are you in the US?  No one is bound by law to care for their elderly parents.  If she has capacity, then your grandmother's care is up to your grandmother.  Even if she didn't have capacity, it has to go through court to be made legal. 

  I've been through the same thing with my narcissistic mother.  She has dementia and is the most vile, evil person I know. I tried to get her guardianship because she has dementia and can't take care of herself.  She got her cousins to fight me over it. I had her in a very nice assisted living home.  The cousins won, mostly because my mother was mad at us and didn't want us to have guardianship....and took her home. Every single caregiver her cousin has hired quit, one stating my mother was the devil. Now the cousin is sick of her and has gone to try to get her guardianship reversed.  We've called Adult Protective Services because she was living alone and because they took her and had everything signed over to them.....house, money, car...  

The combination of dementia and narcissism is a very volatile mixture. She has told every lie she can think of about us, to everyone she knows.  Last week, we were all served with papers.  She's taking us to magistrate court over some of that crazy stuff. I haven't spoken to her in a year, and I will never speak to her again. 

My advise is to get your mother out of there. If she's a true narcissist, she will do everything in her power to control and manipulate both of you into caring for her until she dies.  My mother is 78 years old. Has dementia, with paranoia and psychosis (tested by her psychiatrist).  She has been left alone in her home, can't cook for herself, can't take her meds the right way, can't use the machine to check her blood sugar, can't drive... but still able to wreck havoc in our lives.  

I understand how you feel. When I was reading this, I thought you were my daughter.  Then I read back over it and saw where your mother is still caring for your grandmother. We all despise my mother.  If you can convince your mother to stop caring for your grandmother, you can call adult protective services and file a report about this poor old woman who can't care for herself. You don't have to leave your name.  Tell them you'reta neighbor or something. They have to go check on her if you call. Your mother will not get in any trouble. If they call, just tell them the truth.....she's abusive and you and your mother can not be around her.  Then get you and your mom into therapy. Mental abuse is a terrible thing. 

Good luck. Feel free to private message me. I hate that you and your mother are going through this. ",,,,Ciscokid60,,,1460152380,t5_2rfqf,t3_4d04o2,t3_4d04o2,1,1463315277,0,0,d1vhj5i,dementia,1,,

"Hehe ur grandma dumping out water kinda made me giggle.  Thankfully my grandma only does that with food sometimes &gt;.&gt; and less so with water.  My grandpa used to sneak food to the dog D=.

**Practice Bullet Points**

* She fixates on things, and no matter what you talk about she goes back to the same topic.

* She does in fact seem to be more depressed when the sun goes down.  My mother says this is a thing, I guess her friends parents suffer the same thing.

* Dunno if this is a point to bring up, but you can tell she thinks about what she is saying as she is saying it, not before.  It is like a permanent ad lib in her mind.  Every 3 words or so in a vacuum make sense, but the entire sentence is about like 10 different things.

* We have 3 bathrooms in the house, and she likes to use 2, and quite often she just walks between the two going bathroom all day.  I think this is related to the Depends tho, as in she doesnt wan't to wet herself so she just sits on the toilet all day.

* Sometimes mid sentence she will start talking Japanese, really confusing to me, but I think maybe its her preferred language.

* She plays with her tongue an awful lot lately I noticed.  Maybe its a sign of dehydration, and she needs to drink more.  Like her mouth will be open and her tongue is going all over the place.

* She cannot keep eye contact, cuz I think she forgets she is talking to you mid talking to you.  Sometimes you can be talking to her ask her a question and she gets up and leaves.  Question wasn't rude or anything she just doesn't hear it and goes about her day.

* Really fixates on mantras but it doesn't change her behavior, she just repeats it to herself.  Stuff like ""I'm no good,"" or ""I need to drink my water.""  She will repeat it but won't actually do it.  Just sit there repeating it.

"Hi, I'm a dementia specialist and may be able to offer some advice.

Ultimately, there is no ""right"" thing to do. If your Mother is already struggling with your Father's behaviour then you may find it is best he moves into a residential home. However, there are other options available. I don't know where you are, but here in the UK we have various options which can be partially/fully funded. One option is home care, and this involves nurses/carers coming into the family home to care for your Father in an environment he is familiar with and comfortable with. For these initial stages you may find that to be the best option.

No matter what type of dementia your Father is living with there is massive positives to remaining at home. Being in a familiar environment where he knows where he is could slow down the progression of his dementia, and also improve his experience of living with the dementia. However there are also negatives, which are mainly for yourself and your Mother. If your Mother is going to be his sole carer she needs to be getting support (either emotionally or physically) from outside, she needs days off and breaks away. Being someones sole carer is like working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Being the sole carer for a close relative or partner living with dementia can be very upsetting.

If you chose to go for a residential/nursing home, there are a few things to consider. 
A) The change in environment might result in a permanent decline in your Father's health/behaviour. Challenging behaviour usually results from one of the following things: frustration, pain, discomfort and the inability to communicate these things. From what you've said it sounds like your Father is experiencing a front-temporal dementia which can, in itself, cause him to lose his social inhibitions. The home you choose should be aware of this, and should know how they can begin to deal with it, although it will take time to see improvement if any is made. Try and ensure if possible that all staff are trained in different dementias. 
B) You won't necessarily know if the home is ""good"" until your Father has been there for a month or two. Visiting for a day does not give you a good indication of how the home runs.
C) It would be a good idea to find a home that will let you personalise your Father's bedroom as much as possible. Painting, carpets, anything that is familiar to him and makes him feel more at home.

As I've mentioned before, throughout this try and make sure both you and your Mother are getting emotional support. It sounds like you are feeling very pressured and I can imagine that your Mother is feeling the same. Support groups for carers can be really helpful.

If you have any other questions I'd be glad to answer as much as I can. The only thing I'm not so sure about is the financial side of things, I can help if it's England!

"Can you get counseling through your school?  It's one thing that helps me a lot in dealing with my father.  If you can't, look in to [EMDR therapy](http://www.emdr.com/what-is-emdr/), which is a way to process stress that you can teach yourself.  If you can get counseling, it wouldn't hurt to take your husband with you so that you guys can learn to talk to each other about this stuff.

Personally, it sounds to me like she *should* be in assisted living.  Having round-the-clock personnel on hand to help her, as well as likely having a nurse there is a huge thing.  So is consistent management of her prescriptions.  If she can't afford to do it, consider signing her up for a reverse mortgage to pay for the cost and be sure to find a facility that will take Medicaid for her care after her funds run out.  

I think right now your mind is telling you, ""I can't do this!"" in regard to the move and selling your house.  I know you feel guilty and somewhat responsible, but you honestly do not have to (and should not) sacrifice your well-being for this.  Especially if there are other options.

"The part that is separated may be hospice or total care. We were allowed to spoon feed the hospice residents, by the way. This just meant that if they wanted to eat but could no longer get the food to their mouth on their own, we would cut up their food and feed it to them. So residents can be spoon fed if they are willing, but I am pretty sure it has to be a nursing home vs ALF (Assisted Living Facility), or the resident has to be on hospice. Maybe the rule is state dependent, IDK. You could see if your grandma is just having trouble navigating getting the food to her mouth.

true about the rules. i got her a remote with huge buttons that can't damage the tv setup in any way, a phone that she can use, low energy bulbs that won't up the power bill even if left on 24/7..

it's just that she seems to be pissed at me more often than not, and i can't fix that, and i just can't ignore that. i come home 20 minutes late and she gives me shit about that or doesn't talk to me—even if i called—and whatever good mood i was in is gone in a wink and the only thing i want is to down a couple of shots, or maybe half a bottle

"Looking back the first signs were when my mom stopped wanting to drive. She had always been so active and on the go all her life and she just started telling us she did not want to drive anymore except to the grocery store, or to get her hair done, or to go to church. Places close to her house. So when she wanted to visit relatives from out-of-town, we would drive her and pick her up. When she went to see my sister, which lives 5 hours away, she took the train. At this point in time we absolutely had no idea that she was developing Alzheimer. Just thought it was natural ageing. But looking back, this was the first obvious sign. That was about 8 years ago. She then slowly started not wanting to participate simple activities she had always loved. At this point, I think she started to realize something was wrong, but kept it to herself. She started not keeping the house or yard up anymore which was completely out of character for her. She stopped getting dressed, she would stay in her PJ's all day. She stopped showering and taking care of her personal hygiene. My sister had to start helping her pay her bills. This is when we realized she was having memory issues, but she hid this as much as possible. This is also when we finally realized something was wrong, and took her to see her doctor. The doctor started wanting to see her every three months to evaluate her. While seeing the doctor she kept declining and had a brain scan and her doctor's determined she had Alzheimer disease. It seems that everyone that has Alzheimer presents symptoms in different ways. Presently my mom is going through some pretty bad things, and it will only continue to get worse. But anyway, those were a lot of the first symptoms I noticed, but I was not living with her so I'm sure there were some more obvious symptoms that we just did not notice. Mom as well as most people who get Alzheimer will hide their initial symptoms and deny they have a problem for as long as possible.

Anyway, a few months ago I was chatting with a lady about how she finally convinced her mom to see a doctor. I wish we had thought of this. This is what she said, ""We told my Mom that it doesn't hurt to have a baseline evaluation of your memory for later on. We told her that sometimes people have trouble with their memory that can be helped with vitamins. Like a vitamin D deficiency. Not true in her case but less scary to say and for her to hear. When she was diagnosed, it was easier coming directly from the doctor.""

"I'm a bit older than you (38), and my mother is 65 with dementia (likely vascular). I don't have the option to go home to assist, though I am sure it would help in many ways. But that doesn't mean it's the only way of helping. I hired a caregiver to live-in and help with many things. It has really improved things for both my parents' QOL. I realize hiring a live-in caregiver is not possible for everyone (in our case, it ended up actually being cheaper than most half-way decent nursing homes). But medicare and medicaid will certainly cover home health-aid visits, which could greatly alleviate things for your mother. They will help with light chores and all your father's ADLs, such as showering and dressing. This will give your mom a major break. Derailing your own life is not necessarily the best thing even if it seems kindest. You are correct that financially supplementing your father's care (whether in-home or at a facility) would be a better path than dropping everything to become a nurse-maid just when your professional life is taking off. If you think about it, I bet that is not even what either of your parents would want for you. Also, if your father's mental state and behavior is this badly deteriorated, it may be time to have the nursing home conversation with your mother.

"As the disease progresses, people lose their ability to taste. Often they only want sugary things because they can still taste sweet. The inability to smell or taste impacts their appetite. Also, at the far end of the disease, their swallowing reflex doesn't work anymore. In other words, their brain is so far gone that it doesn't tell the body to swallow anymore. This leads to chewing and cheeking or spitting as well as UR issues. Finally, sometimes they are just ready to stop living and refusing food is a way of doing this.

"Hello fellow youngin'! I am 33 and taking care of my grandmother. 

Sounds like grandma may have depression. Very VERY common. Meds get very tricky at that age, but I do HIGHLY recommend getting her to a psychologist for an evaluation. Preferrebly one that has experience with geriatric psychology. Even if meds are completely out of the picture, since she has most of her faculties, ongoing therapy may be a very good thing for her. Sometimes depression manifests itself in dementia like symptoms and a psychologist and neurologist will be able to tell the difference.

"**Bad driving**
All elders in my family who later developed dementia drove bad first.  Many old people just drive bad due to mobility and vision reasons too, but it's often a sign of dementia.

For the elder that lived in my town I personally witnessed some of it.  It started with mild stuff.  Say they were making a right turn from one not busy road to another, maybe they swung wide going partially into the oncoming lane.  They'd *deny or brush off* the mistake, like they didn't realize it happened.  This sign came about 8 years before the formal dementia diagnosis.  Gradually family members and friends started chauffeuring them more to be ""nice"" but really out of concern out of poor driving habits.  We couldn't get them to give up the keys till a fender-bender that could have been much worse.

**Trouble writing checks** 
Occasionally mixing up the ""pay to the order of"" and ""dollars"" lines.  Or writing kind of cockeyed above the lines.  

**Misdialed phone numbers**
I didn't actually notice this one until I took over finances and looked through old phone bills, but it was interesting.  Their phone company records all long-distance calls by number.  So say my elder's sister's number was 1-555-555-5556, you'd maybe see a 1-minute hang up call or misdial charge for 1-555-555-5565.  Everyone does that.  But what happened around the time the dementia kicked on was that it went from maybe one of these calls every other bill to 3 or 4 on the same monthly statement.

**Paranoia**
For the elder with suspected Lewy Body dementia there was a noticeable increase in paranoia and a sense that the world was going down the tubes.  Increasingly distrustful of others.

**Inappropriate social behavior**
Being openly racist or saying off-color remarks.  What had previously maybe been thought but not said became said.

"What you're going through is extremely difficult, but you don't need me to tell you that. Things with my grandmother are very similar, and I've sort of come to a grudging acceptance of it. There is nothing I can do to stop what she's going through, there was nothing she could have done to prevent it, and it is what it is. Every time I see her I wonder if this is the last time, and I try to just enjoy and appreciate the moments that I have.

Not sure if you have any deceased friends or relatives - I have a few, including a grandmother and uncle who died before I was born. And I think about them a lot, I feel a connection to them and having them in my thoughts makes me feel like I'm keeping their spirits alive or something. And I kinda think about my still living grandmother the same way. I know how much she loves me and how that love will always be constant even after she passes. Life is very difficult and the best we can hope for are small moments of joy, and I try to help her find that joy, smile, laugh, etc. I try not to think too much about what she's going through and the negative aspects. It is what it is and there's nothing I can do except try to just appreciate the moments we share. She always knows what I mean when I hug her.

"""I feel like at this point my main concern is they will just say, just send her to a home, or something along those lines""

A GP is not a psychologist or a neurologist. That's why specialists are so important and why she needs to see one. They will pick up on things that a GP may overlook. 

You've seen dementia before so you kind of know some of the warning signs. Condensing her behavioral changes into bullet points will quickly give a doctor vital info. Example:she has wandering behavior, speech pattern changes, hallucinations, her behavior is worse in the afternoons, etc. Not saying your grandmother has these, but you get the idea, short digestible snippets that indicate something other than ""she's just really old"" may be happening. 

Oh, I forgot to mention last night, there is something you can do to help her. If she is bucking diapers, odds are she is trying to limit her fluid intake to prevent accidents. If you don't already heavily monitor her fluid intake, I highly suggest you do because old people are sneaky as fuck about not drinking. I would give my grandmother a glass of water and tell her she needs to drink it. She'd take 2 sips, wait until I left to do laundry or make lunch or something, then dump out all but a sip or two. She'd wait to finish that last sip until I was back in the room, ask for more, and repeat the process. Eventually i caught her. I ended up having to sit with her and physically watch her drink.  Dehydration does some pretty weird stuff to old people and they can get dehydrated super easily.  ",,,,DoctorFlimFlam,,,1459958350,t5_2rfqf,t3_4dk2p9,t1_d1rwk1f,1,1463259810,0,0,d1s91li,dementia,1,,
"I saw it first hand where family was saying she was ""crazy"" yet no one could pin point it to being ill. While visiting my grandmother I watched her put a pot of water on about 2am. She then went right to bed turning off the light and fell asleep. I waited to see if she was going to come back and she didn't. If I hadn't been there it is likely the apartment would have burnt down. Apparently other relatives had observed her do this a couple times over.

For years grandma would accuse everyone and anyone that someone came up in her apartment and stole her money or jewelry. She even changed the bolt lock she had on her bed room door but according to her she felt her things were still being stolen. It was her forgetting that she hid something in her underwear drawer or wrapped money in toilet paper and put it in a magazine.

Paper was a HUGE issue as well. She'd take tons of toilet paper to wipe herself in the bathroom and throw it in the garbage not flushing it, wrap chewed food up in paper and put it in a pocket or drawer...she'd use toilet paper to wipe her face then the counters. 

We did not know about her work issues because no one called us. She was not able to do her CNA duties and could get other CNAs to do them for her (lift patients, clean them, etc.). She would go to work on the wrong days as well.

When we moved her into my parents home we noticed that she'd refuse to shower. She would also pee on the floor though the bathroom was just a couple of steps away, not more than 10 from her bed.

Cooking would be a long arduous task as she would as the same question six or seven times within five minutes time frame.

I am going to say that those with dementia many times do not acknowledge that something is wrong. I chalked it up to pride, ""No I didn't pee on the floor. It was someone else!"" However, in actuality, it is truth to them. They do not recall doing such a thing and so to them it did not happen. At all. 

I say write down the peculiar things you observe her do. When you go to one of her doctor's appointment, bring it up. See what they say. Don't take ""oh she is getting old"" as the brush off answer. Medicine is at the point where it isn't just senility--they can see if there are issuing going on in the brain and check if hormones are way off.

I called them pops because they only lasted about 15 minutes. During these 15 minutes she would know most of what is going on and then ask me to take her to the doctor to help her die. It was a really rough phase that we went through. 

This phase started after she was told by nurses that she was no longer allowed to use her walker and had to use a wheelchair. The walker was her very VERY last bastion of Independence, and despite the fact that her brain was mostly melted by Dementia, she still realized that she was now 100% dependant on others for everything. That'd be hard for everyone to take let alone someone with severe brain impairments. 

I know this is going to sound terrible, but there is some solace in Gram no longer having lucid moments these days. She isn't aware that she is basically a big 4 month old, and I know that idea would just eat her alive inside if she did know. 

That threshold between semi-lucidity and utter dependence was (at least for me) the toughest period to weather emotionally.

Odds are your mom is in this same period, and if I were to hazard a guess, it is because she is no longer able to walk and can't quite understand fully why anymore. It is a phase and she will likely move through it, though it will take time. ",,,,DoctorFlimFlam,,,1459827756,t5_2rfqf,t3_4dedaf,t3_4dedaf,5,1463226183,0,0,d1qaeuk,dementia,5,,

"The HOPE Bill is definitely a move in the right direction.

&gt;Congress is highly unlikely to pass anything that adds a significant cost to government programs, there's little likelihood of an added Medicare benefit to cover additional caregiving coming to pass.

Totally agree. 

But, if Medicare would just cover 40 hours a week for a family member, experienced dementia caregiver, or CNA. That would be a HUGE help. This one change would make it so a person that is responsible for caring for a loved one with dementia can work to pay the bills *and* care for their love one. Or in the case of an elderly person trying to care for a husband or wife. If they could just get 40 hours a week of help, it would make their lives safer and better. 40 hours a week for an experienced dementia caregiver would be less expensive than 20 hours a week for a LPN, RN.

"Advocating for someone in their 90's especially when it comes to medical stuff... how do I put this nicely... just don't take no for an answer if you think something needs to be seriously addressed. Start with her primary care physician. Make an appt for a full checkup (and urinalysis) and explain your concerns. I recommend you go with her to this doctors appt. Ask for a referral to see either a neurologist or a geriatric psychologist. If the doctor is like 'eh, it might be X but that is common at this age', press the issue and get a referral and a formal diagnosis. There are cognitive tests for dementia. Hopefully you won't have to push as hard as I did with my grandmother's doctors. Laziest GP I've ever met!

Talk to the doctor about her concerning behaviors but don't do it right in front of her. Request to speak to the doc briefly prior to the appt in private. You don't want to embarrass your grandmother. She has her dignity too. 

My family didn't believe me when I said that I suspected gram had dementia. They would always say ""well I just talked to her/saw her and she seemed just fine"". Yeah, that's nice that they got to experience her at her best, but I saw gram when she was far from her best and something was SERIOUSLY wrong with her. Turns out gram had Dementia with Lewy Bodies. It's like one of the nastiest types of dementia. 

If they are not around her all the time, it is easy for her to hide issues from them. It is near impossible for her to hide issues from you. Dementia isn't a constant thing. It comes and goes.

If your dad has behaviors, that is going to likely be your reality too.

"From my experience seeing many families deal with similar situations, by far the best solution for everyone, especially your grandmother and grandfather, is to move into an assisted living facility. Your grandfather is a smart man. He already knows it's the best solution. Hopefully, he will finally make the move, even if it means your grandmother will be kicking and screaming the whole time. If the facility is good (and there are a lot of excellent assisted living facility all over the county), in a couple of months your grandmother's attitude will probably change for the better, especially once she sees the good care she and your grandfather are receiving. As far as you, your mother and uncle, it's hard to give people advice on how they should or could react to a situation, but if it were me, I would tell grandmother as lovingly as possible (mom for your mother) that you agree with your grandfather (father), and that both she and grandfather need assistance, while constantly reassuring her that this is the best solution. She will probably still be upset, but like I said before, once she gets accustomed to being taking care of, she will adjust.

"Truthfully, I do not think there is a way for her to tell she is having a delusion while it is happening. When someone is having a delusion, that is their complete and total reality. When she is having a delusion trying to convince her she is having a delusion may upset and agitate her.  I agree with c5hwg60, that while she is having the delusion just live in her delusion with her. Show her lots of love and compassion and slowly bring here back to reality by guiding her train of thought back to reality. Once she is back, and she seems in a good place, you can then lovingly tell her she was having a delusion. It's very hard to recognize a delusion while you are having it. It's much easier to recognize it after it has happened.   ",,,,fitsme2atee,,,1461388693,t5_2rfqf,t3_4fyr9g,t3_4fyr9g,2,1463633640,0,0,d2e07fc,dementia,2,,
"Hi,
Thanks for replying. 
indeed doctors have mentioned front-temporal dementia. I'm not sure if it's usual to wait for that long to have a diagnosis (we've been waiting for more than 5 months now)...
And as you have mentioned it too he has already lost all social inhibitions (for example at the moment we are trying to sell his business, everytime a suitor comes he will tell them ""are you here to fuck my wife?"") and that's just an example. 
He changed completely in a very short time. My parents live in France so do I at the moment, my mother saw a social worker to tell her about her options, which are rather limited as they live in a rural area...
He was in a facility about 6 months ago, when he started acting strange and it definitely wasn't for him, since he came back he could no longer sleep alone or be left alone at night, he's very anxious all the time. 
To be honest I feel a bit more guilty about leaving my mother alone than about moving my father in a residential home. 
She's already on the verge of breaking down. Another worry is that my siblings and I live far away from my parents (they are all abroad) so my father would be very isolated if he also ""lost"" my mother. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this and to answer, it was very helpful and important for me. ",,,,NowInExile,,,1459670517,t5_2rfqf,t3_4d123a,t1_d1nh4ld,1,1463184935,0,0,d1nw3fu,dementia,1,,

"Cruel as it may sound, if your grandmother really is almost demented enough to be declared incompetent, it's time for your family to stop accepting her protests. No fighting or arguing about it. This is what's best. Hell, in her clearer moments, this is what she seems to want. Gently explaining what is happening and why and being enthusiastic about the good parts of it are the only things that can be done.

Also, as far as your mother and her brother go, it's important for them to be united and to be on the same page about what they are dealing with.

"Personally I believe music is very therapeutic, however I do not believe a specific genre will speak to any dementia patient. I also don't believe that every single patient will respond to music. That being said, if you manage to find a person who used to love music and can pinpoint what 'speaks' to them, the results can be astounding!

I take care of my grandmother. She is 92 and has dementia with Lewy Bodies. Sadly gram can have some aggressive tendencies. We have used music to try to redirect aggressive behavior.

Gram loved music, specifically piano, and Latin guitar. We used music to redirect behavior. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. This music was what we used when she was a bit more high functioning.

Now I don't especially call it music, but meditative soundtracks seems to work very very well for gram these days. Think of it as a step above white noise. Gram is pretty low functioning these days and calming, meditative spa-like 'music'/noise seems to have a major calming affect on her. It's soothing tones, rain noises, soft wind chimes, etc. 

Honestly I think this is a great subject to explore, but I also think it is surprisingly complicated because what works for one dementia patient will never work for all.  

That being said, here is a very uplifting video about [music and dementia](https://youtu.be/fyZQf0p73QM). 

FYI, my grandmother never had a reaction like this to music. I wish it was as easy as hitting 'play' on an IPod. I have this theory about long established neuro pathways and that dementia destroys the main route to memories, but old memories may still be there, we just need to find an alternate way to get to that memory. Kind of like a highway is closed and you take a ton of surface streets to get to the same destination. Music may be that surface Street path for some patients.

The hard thing is when we have unfinished business, things we wish to say to our loved one with dementia, but we know they can no longer understand because they are lost in the fog of their disease. My advice to you is that if you think a call would relieve some of your guilt, you should fortify yourself in whatever way works for you_ meditation, yoga, a Xanax, just whatever works for you personally (I usually have a glass of wine before calling my dad), and just do it. Even if it seems he can't understand you, can't reply coherently, say what you want to say. We never know exactly how much the demented understand. Sometimes way more than we think. They certainly recognize the tone of voice that expresses love. Tell him your happy memories, regrets and that you love him. If you feel like apologizing for anything, now's the time.  I think it would lift a weight off your chest. Sadly you'll never get an apology for the shitty things he said about being surprised you were able to advance in your education etc. I think it's best to just look at those comments as being from someone with huge emotional limitations who was just parroting what your mother said. My dad did similar, still does. And I'm not gonna lie, it still hurts and pisses me off, even though he is now a very frail, sick old man. But I also know I'll have huge regrets if I spend  our last conversations being angry, waiting for an apology that will never come, arguing etc. If you can still call him with love in your heart, I think it will be greatly to your benefit.

I do believe it's possible that your family could do a better job of feeding your Grandma. That said, there's probably a good reason why she isn't eating so much, and getting her those calories might be more work than you imagine. 

In our building, we put the food in front of them, slice the meat for those who need help, and offer positive reinforcement. But we legally can't put the food into their mouths, and some residents end up spending an extra hour at meal-time. And even then, they might only take a few bites. 

People get pickier, they lose interest in eating, they get confused by eating - any reason you can imagine. And there's no way staff has the time to sit with the residents that need help - because they'd have to be sitting with them for the entire meal, one-on-one, bite-by-bite, and there simply isn't the manpower. Out of our 15 residents, at least 7 of them aren't eating much at most meals. And our food is really good! For those who need ensure, we certainly make sure they get it regularly.

"For some people, it is a pretty clear choice. Like there is an actual event that screams 'facility'; like they start falling, or wandering from the home, or negatively impacting the lives of others living in the home. For others it is not so clear. Personally, and this is just my own feelings on the subject and there are definitely differing opinions on this, a good indicator is quality of life (as you already mentioned).

Quality of life is going to be shitty by normal standards for your dad no matter which option you choose (that is just how dementia goes), it is just going to come down to which is a less shitty choice for him. 

Adult daycare is not really a great metric to go off of because it is so incredibly temporary. Of course he isn't going to like it, it is out of his comfort zone. There is no opportunity for him to settle into a new routine and man, routine is so key! A new routine takes quite a while to establish. 

Usually the main question is - are they unsafe in their current environment? And if not now, will their care needs reach a level that it will become unsafe? Other things to consider is whether you think he would benefit from socialization? Socialization is really really important, even for people suffering from dementia.

Now, a major downside is the one on one care that usually exists in a home environment does not exist in a facility. 

I've seen both sides of this. I've taken care of my husband's grandma for 3 years in her home (she as Dementia with Lewy Bodies). My dad's Mom is in a facility (she has Alzheimer's). About a year ago I was begging husband's family to agree to put gram in a facility. They said they didn't feel comfortable with forcing her into a facility because she once said she didn't want to go. I get that they were trying to be respectful towards her but grams quality of life was just as bad as it could have been. She was begging to die on a daily basis and I truly believed that getting her into a more social environment, even a memory care unit, would have been an improvement for her. I expressed this to the family. They snubbed their noses at the idea. So gram stayed at home, bored, depressed, and miserable. We tried to get her socialized but she refused to leave the house. We tried activities but she was so bored and depressed that she flat out refused. Just an all around shitty quality of life, and that makes me both sad, and angry at the family for not growing a set and doing what was actually best for gram, and not what felt easiest at the time for them [guilt-wise]. 

On the other side of things is my dad's mom. She is in a facility and she HATED it for a long time. Like a really long time, but dad started her in an assisted living situation and then eventually had to move her into memory care. The transition was rough for her, but eventually she acclimated and she is doing, well OK, as far as an 87 year old with Alzheimer's can be doing. She even had a 'boyfriend' at one point. They held hands at lunchtime and that was about it. Her level of care is no where near as one on one as my husband's grandmother is, but she benefits from field trips and dance parties and live music and whatnot. Her facility is kind of amazing. Overall my dad's mom seems a lot less miserable. Oh, and she is also completely non verbal.

That being said not everyone fairs as well in a facility environment, and not all facilities are created equal. There are some really shitty facilities out there that I would NEVER put a relative in. Sometimes there is a happy middle ground too. Some facilities offer home care and they will take care of an individual at home and also bring the patient on any field trips or other social outing being offered by the facility. Sometimes this is a nice middle ground/transition. Not sure if any of the facilities in your area offers that, but I think that is super cool that that is an option available at some places.

I wish I had an easy answer for you, but for some it is not so black and white. Dementia is both tricky and cruel and it really comes down to where you genuinely think your dad will be less miserable in the long run. If you think that a facility is a better choice, sooner rather than later is always my answer because it gives them more time to adjust into a new routine.

"IMO, this statement exemplifies inverted causality. Rather than dementia causing significant weight loss, fact is that people vulnerable to dementia later in life, are too thin for the amount of food that they eat.

The energy density is very high in at-risk brains due to a more dopaminergic neurostructural ideology. E.g.: “People who have more activity in their default mode networks may have increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease. As Holtzman of Washington University says, “people whose default mode networks have an average increase in activity relative to others may be at increased risk to get Alzheimer’s disease later in life; lesser the activity in this network, lesser the risk”.

Vulnerable people are those with a high (mental) metabolic rate: not visibly overactive (that is, physically -- not mentally) people who eat a lot but remain thin; hair loss appears to be another key symptom of ""neuropyrosis"", i.e. hurtful stress* due to excessive metabolism (excess activity of dopaminic booster gates). I call it ""neuropyrosis"" because initially i suspected thermal stress, but the culprit might well be chemical (e.g.: oxidative) or mechanical stress.

"Such a good idea :) 

Half of the problem, from where I stand as a carer of my mother with dementia is that, for a long time, people having to deal with someone with dementia really don't understand and are not made aware of the depth of disability the person suffers and the decline they will be on, because they still insist on seeing the person as somehow ""there"" in the way they were before, and they think they can stop that decline... probably mainly because there are no ready resources about dementia, as you say. I was not pointed to any learning curve by anyone.

In addition to not being pointed at the learning curve I needed to surmount, I did not actively seek such a learning curve myself, I think I was pretty much in denial at having to lose the person I knew and loved to the disease.

Result was that, in ongoing day-to-day denial of how bad things really were and were likely to get, I for ages rejected the need to even acknowledge - let alone accept - the depth of her disability. And of course, I therefore really did fail for ages to act appropriately in dealing with my mother's anxieties and depression, her hallucinations and delusions and ever increasingly disruptive behaviours (so, sorry Mom).

I do think you are really right in thinking there needs to be an in depth wiki or something out there that people struggling as we have could turn to. I often read posts here about someone or the other's struggle to deal with a person with dementia and I feel I know exactly where the person is in the evolution between denial and acceptance that I've had to go through. 

Its a hell of a journey towards acceptance. And its only after acceptance that I could muster the energy and focused creativity needed to find the idiosyncratic practical solution for each of the disruptive behaviours that were making my life as a carer and my mother's life as a dementia patient a living hell. 

I mean, it took me for ever to accept my mother was incontinent at night and that it was past time for me to stop fighting that deterioration off, to make sure she got a big lunch and only a blended evening meal, to buy her adult diapers, to put her to bed in a catsuit put on backwards so she could not remove it, to wake her for a late loo, to wake her again for an early loo - all so as to avoid the poo.

"Piggybacking on this thread, but in a general sense when is the right time to put someone in a memory care facility?

My dad has lost much of his language ability and physically can hardly walk anymore, except maybe ten steps before he needs to sit. But he otherwise kind of knows what's up. It's hard to explain, but in some sense he's a total mess and occasionally has anger problems, but in general he knows who he is, who we are, and would hate to be moved to a facility (we tried daycare a couple years ago and he hated it).

His quality of life isn't great at home, but we have a lot of daytime care and he at least gets out a bit (I wheel him around the block with my dog sometimes, and the caretakers take him out daily for a ride and sometime a ""walk"" in his wheelchair). I worry he'll hate a memory care place (even a nice one we found). But he sort of languishes at home too.

Any thoughts are appreciated.",,,,tnitty,,,1461483807,t5_2rfqf,t3_4g3pjt,t1_d2enkjd,1,1463653568,0,0,d2f5rbb,dementia,1,,

"My grandmother(75) has some form of dementia but not necessarily Alzheimers. She's waiting for assessment on Tuesday next week after which we're hoping that she'll get a spot in a nursing home or at least a home nurse. 

It started with forgetfulness: Having to double, triple or quadruple check that she has everything(Keys, wallet etc)with her. Not remembering what she had for breakfast or what day she did a certain activity. It's was very mild stuff at first, not debilitating at all and it could very well be attributed to her age. But this forgetfulness increased in severity overtime until she no longer remembered to pay bills, can't recall her pin code, phone numbers, asks the same question several times in the span of a few minutes etc. She was still very clear in her mind at this point, just extremely forgetful.

After around a year of this extreme forgetfulness something in her mind just broke, almost immediately. Went from being clear in the head to no longer having a grasp of reality, all in a matter of weeks. On a good day it ranges from conversations with photographs, telling stories that never happened, not understanding the reason for paying bills, asking why she can't find the battery hatch on her oven etc. She can be ""fun"" on those days and during her moments of clarity she can even laugh at herself. On a bad day she's accusing people of stealing stuff that she misplaced, visiting her neighbors in the middle of the night asking them to help her find her imaginary friends, trying to discuss ridiculous conspiracy theories, her favorite one is how her landlord moved her apartment to another building during the night. Basically full psychosis. And when she's like this it's rather painful for her because in her mind all this makes sense, she doesn't understand that there is a void of logic that we(her family) can't follow. I assume that it's extremely frustrating and hurtful to her that her own family doesn't understand things which to her is both logical and clear as day.

I'm a bit ignorant of dementia(which is why I came to this sub today looking for answers) so I don't know for sure if that initial forgetfulness was the start or if what we're experiencing now is the start. I assume we'll get answers to that once a professional has assessed her situation. But perhaps you can see some likeness in the behavior of my grandmother and your mother.",,,,Jauxerous,,,1460480172,t5_2rfqf,t3_4dymso,t3_4dymso,2,1463392986,0,0,d2002t6,dementia,2,,
"First step: stop beating yourself up. We are NOT well-suited in this modern world to babysit our elderly. Even large families with lots of help within don't cope very well. It has a lot to do with the time pressures we all have just getting by day-to-day.

I'm speaking from experience. I have cared for my Mom for over a decade, and for about four of those years Mom has had dementia. Rule number one, I have learned, is that *the caregiver has to take care of themselves first.* If you're sick or exhausted you can't be an effective caregiver. Tell your internal tape recorder that's dishing out guilt at you to just stop. You're doing the best you can. In no sense of the word did you sign up to become a caregiver for an elderly person, even if that person is a parent or parent-in-law. *Particularly* an elder who has dementia.

Dementia is *horrible* and it gets progressively worse. It does not get better. It's terminal. If the dementia doesn't kill your MIL, a stroke or heart disease or bad fall will. Pneumonia is often the killer, because in the very late stages of dementia the patient loses the swallowing reflex and often aspirates food. Food particles can kick off a lung infection and then it's just a matter of time.

Putting your MIL into assisted living now rather than later might be the smartest thing to do. Your duty of care is to make sure she's safe, or as safe as can be. An AL facility can help with that, and when the time comes, a full-on nursing home is probably in the cards. Dementia patients fall a lot. Imagine how horrifying it would be to come home and find your loved one on the floor with a broken hip or pelvis. Don't set yourself up for that eventuality.

Once again, stop beating yourself up. Talk to your husband and his family about getting her into a facility where she can be cared for by professionals. That way the time you spend caring for her, buying groceries, cleaning, whatever, can be spent on actually visiting her instead. It'll change your world, and hers, for the better.

Best of luck.",,,,HeSayYouBradeRunner,,,1461619109,t5_2rfqf,t3_4gctbn,t3_4gctbn,3,1463686568,0,0,d2h2p3t,dementia,3,,

"Looking at your situation, it sounds like neither your nor you husband are prepared to be caregivers for a parent with dementia, and that's OK. At this time in your life, you are where you need to be. You are going to school to prepare for your future, and that's what you need to be doing right now. You should never, ever feel guilty for that. Furthermore, no one should ever feel guilty for not being able to care for a person with dementia, Period. I have seen families put in very dangerous situations when trying to care for someone with dementia. 

From my experience, please do not move in with your MIL. The stress for you and your husband will only get worse. A whole lot worse. Lots of people in your situation have either moved in with the parent with dementia, or had the parent move in with them. For most people that are facing this situation for the first time, it seems like the logical thing too do. Unfortunately, when dealing with someone with dementia, the majority of the time, it turns out to be the worse thing to do for everyone. The only exception, I have seen, is when there is a family member or very close friend that has no job or commitments outside the home, and they can spend 24/7 taking care of the person with dementia and be OK taking care of a demented person. However, these types of people are few and far between, and most people/families do not have someone like this.

I agree fully with thatredheadedfella. A good Assisted living facility with a memory care unit/community is by far the very best option for everyone. A good facility would take very good care of your MIL, and you and your husband can live a normal life. 

The second best option is to hire experienced in-home caregivers for around the clock care. Sometimes this is the preferred option for some families and can work out very well also. However, if your do put your MIL in a facility, or hire in-home caregivers, visit her often, because she will still need you and your husband in her life.

Dinner was ready, but unfortunately it was ready 20 minutes after the usual dinner time.

This went on non stop until bedtime...3 hours later. That night I got drunk and cried myself to sleep.
