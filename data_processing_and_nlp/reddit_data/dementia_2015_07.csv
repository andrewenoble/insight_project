"Thank you for your response. I tried to call obudsman and the state but only could leave a message but no response after a few weeks. Local social worker seems to be useless and seems to not care about my concerns. 

Some things i did not mention is that physically she can not walk due to weak legs and her left arm does not work. Mentally, her dementia is not getting better, she os starting to stutter her words and she has lost a big patch of hair on her head (maybe from pulling or scratching). This is completely new and i suspect that it is happening since she constantly wants to go to the restroom and can not ask for help (does not know how to use the button for help and her room mates screaming drowns out her cries for help).

Today alone, i came in to see her with the bed pointed downwards and pillows stuffed on the sides. She was crying saying someone stole her watch (she does not have a watch there, probably something she thought of). I have my number littered across the room and always tell them to call me when she is in distress but they stopped calling after a few failed attempts to calm her down.  I asked that they turn to tv on for her or something but i rarely see it turned on.

I completely understand that the CNAs are over worked and understaffed plus i can be extremely difficult to work with someone who you have difficulty communicating to. They also turn off the lights around 7pm and try to get her and her room mates to sleep and i think its another contributing factor to her pulling her hair. 

No one should be forced to be stuck in a dark room and in bed all the time. I feel so helpless since all the facilities that are good are full in san francisco and i live an hour away from her. I already visit 2-3 days week and at least 3+ hours each visit but i feel so worn out and its just a bandaid to the underlying problem.

I can't tell you how many people fell away from us during this 12 year ordeal. Her sister, all of her nieces and nephews, friends, her own daughter... this disease is cruel to everyone involved. It's not easy to always set aside our own feelings, but with dementia, you just have to. Think of how your grandfather feels. This disease leaves the caregiver alienated and feeling hopeless, it is extremely lonely and isolating.

The worse part of this? Your grandmother *will* have moments of clarity. 

My grandma was confused, yes, lost at times... but what I will always remember were her good days-- she spent most of them crying and distraught, not able to comprehend where all of her family went and why no one answered the phone. Please do not do this to her, or your grandfather. Be there for them... call, write letters, send cards. And if she remembers you as someone else in her mind, just go with it.

"Where is my previous comment? / apologia for comment submitted before I was done commenting.  

I think that anxiety can be a symptom of dementia, but it sounds as if she may have more anxiety than dementia.  Tell you what, if I went though 90 days worth of Ativan in 60 days, I would be pretty anxious, too.  I would be surprised if she was sleeping much at all, and that can make you even more disassociated from reality.  

If she is able to get more Ativan, would it be possible for you to limit her consumption to a pill a day?  She might need a higher dosage than what she had been taking, because she wasn't taking the prescribed dosage anyway.  Do be aware that Ativan is addictive, and will need to be increased with time to get to same effect.  There may be better anti-anxiety med that she could take, longer-term, without the risk of addiction, but that is her doctor's call.  

Finally, don't take her dementia/anxiety as a sign that you are doing something wrong.  You are a good person for helping her, but you have to treat yourself well in order to be strong enough to take care of her.  Take as good care of yourself as you take of her.

"Me or the writer or both? My father in law was exhibiting symptoms in his 50's, and my husbands also started early 50's. Slow, just odd stuff at first. We would have a conversation and then later he wouldn't remember. Said I must have conversations with him in my head. Then got to where he would get upset about small things, I now know he was forgetting where things were, he stopped doing the remodeling, as he was forgetting how to do things. When I was selling and cleaning out this last year, I found bags and bags of stuff from Home Depot for projects that he forgot he bought and then bought more. Love Home Depot. They took it all back! 

What messed things up and I couldn't get any help from the doctors was he suddenly started drinking! Out of character. The doctors said he was just a drunk. I took his car and alcohol away and it turned out he was just forgetting he had had a drink and then had more! They said I couldn't do that, it had to be his ""choice"" to quit. I fired all three of them. 

He is 61 now, doing fine, just no memory. Loves to help me with stuff, but needs supervision. I had him cut down a large bush and he got stuck in cut down mode and went after my 40 year old rose bush. We hid his the saw, the rose is growing back and he has forgotten all about bushes. 

The big difference between him and his father and uncle is they always blamed anyone and everyone around them until the day they died. My husband and I have a good relationship and when I finally figured it all out, I have never lied to him about his dementia and since he trusts me, we are doing fine.

"ShaylaBrieann speaks the truth my friend. I am taking care of my 80 year old father who has been diagnosed with moderate dementia in early April. 
Though onset has easily been for 2 years, I will spare the long story. :).

Please, for your sake and your grandpa's sake, continue to maintain contact with your Grandma. It is important and worthwhile for all 3 of you... As hard as it may be sometime.

Also, please check out the book ""The 36 Hour Day"". It is a great resource for everyone dealing with dementia. It will show through example and science how dementia manifests itself in the different stages.

Your grandma might not recall who you are when you call her because of the lack of information (she can't see your face, she can only hear a voice saying a name). But if your grandma sees a photo of you (maybe a photo a few years ago when you were younger, or a baby), she might recognize who you are because of a greater information in her surroundings.

"You might not be able to convince them. Our girlfriends mom moved in over a year ago. She's had a pacemaker put in, started using a walker, memory is completely shot, often forgetting what happened seconds ago, and she's fallen numerous times and needed assistance just to get off the floor. 3 emergency room trips. Any of which would have surely killed her if she stayed at her apartment and no one randomly showed up and rescued her. She's still convinced she could and should be living alone, meanwhile we're trying to figure out whether its time for a place with professional 24 hour care.

My girlfriend was in the same situation, all the brothers and sisters didn't want to deal with it, and definitely didn't want to take the leading role. So she took over all of her mothers finances, doctors appointments etc, and had her mom move in. Problem solved, now her moms somewhere she can't die from something easily preventable and my girlfriend feels like she did the right thing. No, turns out that's just the beginning.

Fast forward a year. Just the other day my girlfriend cried herself to sleep because she forgot something minor that day, she's completely terrified by the idea of loosing her memory like her mom. She frequently talks about how she just wants to die if she gets diagnosed with Alzheimer's and her daughters have expressed similar sentiments. These aren't gloomy people. My girlfriend goes with her adult kids to animated Disney movies still.

The house smells, all day, every day. We can clean thoroughly and get it smelling fine, but a couple of days later its bad again. We're going to throw away the carpet and probably also some of the wood under it in the room she sleeps in, as well as replacing the sink and remodeling her bathroom when she no longer lives there. We'll also be getting rid of the couches she sits on. Anytime she uses the main bathroom I have to go and mop and clean so the smell isn't nauseating when I have to use it longer then I can hold my breath later on. And I'm the most used to it. My girlfriends daughters who (now) infrequently come to visit aren't.

Her mothers emotional state is pretty poor. She cries at the drop of a hat, if you point out or do anything that indicates that memory loss, odor, or sanitation is an issue. She absolutely refuses any assistance, professional or otherwise, with hygiene or bathroom use. Crying leads to depression if she's not quickly distracted. Depression which can last three days, during which we hear (over and over) about her abusive marriage and how she did nothing while her husband repeatedly molested her daughter 50 years ago (not my girlfriend) and about how that daughter somehow shouldn't hold that against her. Its pretty awkward because she has no filter, so she'll start doing it regardless of who's around. So after she goes to church every Sunday, instead of getting a much needed break from the stress of her care, we frantically clean and do all the things that would upset her if we did them while she was around.

Everything we do while she's in the room is at least a little choreographed for her benefit, meaningful conversations only happen out of earshot. Its impossible to predict what will upset her, one time we were watching Jon Stewart on TV (after we gave up on waiting for her to go to bed), and Jon said something snarky concerning a republicans pro-life position. Her mom left the room ""quickly"". Next week my girlfriend finds out from her brother that her mother kept saying that my girlfriend said hideous things about fetuses (none of which was actually said by anyone, including Jon). That wasn't the first or last time that sort of thing happened. Its very common for her to fill in blanks in her memory with falsehoods, then vehemently defend their accuracy. Currently she's convinced we gave away her ticket to a play to one of my girlfriends daughters and is upset about it. The reality is we bought her the ticket months in advance and she spent the entire week prior insisting that she didn't want to go and that she didn't care for the play that would be on.

What she's living isn't a life, she can't 'handle' her declared favorite TV shows or books, or anything else she says she enjoys when asked. She loves my girlfriends Chihuahua, she spends all day petting it. Its adorable. She's poisoned it several times; onions, tea, and poop judging from his breath and the vet visits.

What's around her isn't family, its a troupe putting on an act to avoid upsetting her and to distract her from her suffering.

What my girlfriend is caring for isn't her mother, its a ghost reenacting a tragedy, that's slowly loosing interest in the business of haunting. The rest of the time its a zombie.

If she stayed in that apartment alone she would've been happier, everyone would've been able to remember her for who she really is, not what she has become. She would've kept her independence which was so important to her after she escaped her marriage. She wouldn't have to live in a house where even after a year she can't find the light switches, a constant reminder of the loss of her ability to learn. One morning she's going to wake up and ask us why she slept over last night. She already occasionally forgets the walker she's used constantly for the past year.

I'm not in a position to assess your situation or predict how some choices would turn out, obviously. I'm mostly venting, but I'm also here to advocate for considering what's now unthinkable, what might look better in retrospect. The hands off approach. Spend time with them of course. Help, naturally. Ask them what they need and how they want to receive it. But don't forget that putting safety and longevity over happiness may be a misuse of their time. Old folks don't like change, that goes double if they have memory loss. Trading an hour now for an extra week added to the end of his life might be a rip off.

But definitely push them to go as far as the diagnosis. There are treatable things that cause memory loss that aren't Alzheimer's.

"I'm very conflicted about responding to this because you seem like a good kid with well meaning intentions so part of me feels as though I shouldn't comment and just let it be. 

But the other part (the obviously louder part) feels the need to explain that dementia isn't ""forgetting memories"". Yes, that can be a symptom of the disease but it's not the only thing that happens. Hell, it's not even the worst thing that happens. When people have dementia they loose their ability to do the things that they've spent their entire adult lives doing. They loose common sense and reasoning. Their emotions become irrational. Someone might walk into a grocery store and absentmindedly put their keys down in the apple bin instead of in their purse and not notice until they are through grocery shopping and go to their car. A healthy person will search frantically, retracing their steps and asking employees for help. A person with dementia won't have the reasoning to figure out where their keys could be or to even think that if they drove to the store their keys can't be far. So they might try to walk home or they'll sit on a bench for hours out of sheer confusion. 

If the point of your exercise is to get people to think about how detrimental dementia can be then I think a better activity would be to set up a simple and well known task but put some sort of unforeseen element into the task that makes it impossible. When that person is unable to complete the task that they know their capable of doing but can't figure out why they can't do it then you can reveal to them that this is similar to the frustrations of people with dementia.

If your point is to have a mindful activity then maybe you could ask family members and care givers from the home you visited to write down short memories of their loved ones - hell, I bet people from this sub would contribute too, and have people on the street read memories from the memory tree. Allow people to add their own, as well. 

Anyways, I hope you take this in the spirit I intend, which is to help you have a better experience for you and your town! ",false,false,t1_ct193ik,SarahMakesYouStrong,,0,1436751451,t5_2rfqf,t3_3d1rt7,t3_3d1rt7,2,1437807987,0,0,ct193ik,dementia,2,,

I think you'll find that interacting with them is linear enough to worry about maintaining a false persona.  Listen to the music with her, hold her hand and talk to her about your life.  If she wants to talk, listen.  Don't try to correct her if she is wrong.  They have to live very much in the moment, so just try to make the moments as pleasant as possible.

"Have you gotten in touch with hospice? Depending on the organization, many hospice groups offer some in-home services, but maybe admitting him to the local in-patient hospice, if there is one, would be ideal, and better than an assisted-living facility. I have had experience with a friend in one of those, and the situation was not good. As she got more and more out of her mind it was obvious that many of its aides either had no training dealing with late-stage dementia patients or they disregarded any training they had received. They kept my friend only because their job was to have no vacancies, and it didn't matter that maybe a patient was no longer suitable for what that facility could offer.
