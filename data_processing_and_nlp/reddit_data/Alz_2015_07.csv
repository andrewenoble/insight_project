"Women live longer, but I also herd that the disease progresses a little bit slower in women, leading them to survive the disease for a longer period of time. 

I sometimes wonder about things like nail polish and the various chemicals women are exposed to, that men aren't. 

When men are exposed to something, it's more often job related or a local thing.

"Well, you can't just move people willy nilly, they are adults. What does your dad want to do? What does your mom want to do? I understand she has alz, but she's still in there... Are you the power of attorney? You can't just steamroll your parents because you know better. Everyone has to be on board. Maybe they want to live out their days in their own home. If they are hesitant to move, hiring a cleaning crew to come in every other week would help your dad in the meantime. Look into a respite caregiver so your dad can take time to do things for himself without having to worry about your mom. It's a lot to ask anyone to up end their lives and move 8 hours away. There are alz and dementia specific care facilities, however I do not believe they are short term. Also, having a big home for everyone to live in is one thing, but you're going to need a somewhat handicap accessible home. It's difficult to retrofit homes so bear that in mind. We built our home knowing there'd be wheelchairs eventually, and 15 years later we finally actually need it. There's a lot to consider. Your dad may not want your mom to go into a home, they may want to move into a senior apartment complex together but don't know what to do with your brother. Have you talked to your brother? My dad and I are my grandma's primary caregivers, I'm here everyday; my brother lives an hour away and has no idea what it takes to care for her and it really upsets me that he thinks he knows better than me or my dad.

"I am sorry you and your loved ones are going through this. I don't know your family or your situation, so understand this advice comes from a gut feeling after reading your post. I believe your mother in law is having a hard time coping. My SO has Alzheimer's. I'm younger, in relatively good health and thought I could do this just fine.  I was wrong. I needed help. I needed help and didn't know how to ask, what to ask for, or when to ask for help. I became easily overwhelmed and eventually my bodies response was to make me emotionally numb. Sure I freaked out at first and cried and screamed etc. but one day I just sort of fogged over. Important things got missed. I realized I couldn't do it alone and that I needed more help. I found a Alzheimer's support group, and eventually got respite care so I had a break. After that I hired a caregiver to come in for a few hours a day a few days a week and do the things that I dreaded and two days a week the caregiver comes over for 5 hours and I leave. I spend one day doing things solely for me. The other day I run errands that I can't get done during the week. Even if money is an issue try to step in one day a week and commit to visiting for an hour and a half. Make sure your mother in law knows it's okay to leave during your visit:) encourage other family members and friends to pick a different day of the week To do the same.

As far as cleaning goes ... He tells me that they have a maid come by. She has to be the worst and doesn't actually do anything, because I've never seen her and it gets worse everytime I go down there.

I called to have the carpets cleaned and he told me that they were just done (they looked like they hadn't been cleaned in over a year).

"First off, you can't reason with her at this point. What you need to do is get them to go and do their normal morning routine, and then after they eat ""breakfast,"" get them to do something sedentary, like watch TV, or read a book if at all possible. Then in a little while start yawning and suggest that it's time to go to bed. If that doesn't work, try again in a little while. Remember, if they're not sleeping right now, it's not the end of the world. Stay calm and collected, and just try to keep her in the house. She'll go back to bed eventually. Also, if she's trying to leave for work or church or whatever, just tell her, calmly, rationally, that it's not the day for that. Just say that's it's the 4th of July so she can't go to work, or that it's Thursday, so it's not time for church. Main thing is to find out where she wants to go, and then just keep her from going there. 

One last trick, if you can't keep her in the house, is to suggest to drive her there yourself, and then either drive around for a while and come home. She'll probably forget what she wanted to do in the first place. But remember to STAY CALM!!!

"Hi, sounds like you have a difficult situation on your hands.  I'm sure it's frustrating being so far away.  A couple notes:

You can definitely find short term care for your mom.  Many, if not most, alzheimer's and assisted living facilities offer what is called ""respite care.""  Essentially, it's meant for a short term stay so that the caregiver(s) can have a break, but it sounds like it would work in your case as well.

Also, I wouldn't push your dad too hard on the support group thing.  Some people are just not the type of people that would get much benefit from that sort of thing.  Personally, it would be torture and I would hate every minute.  Rather than a support group, I met with an elder care attorney who gave me advice about financial planning and did the power of attorney, etc., and he also hooked me up with a nurse whose specialty is evaluating living situations, and helping to come up short-term and long-term ideas to provide the best care.  For me, this logical guidance was much more helpful than the emotional support from a group.  Every situation is different so I wanted people familiar with my situation to give me advice.  If your father is internet-saavy and curious, there are several discussion boards regarding alzheimer's that he may find helpful.

If your folks and brother stay where they are, I recommend hiring someone to come in and clean.  As time goes on they can do more, e.g. cooking, laundry, etc.  Pressuring your brother to do that sort of stuff will likely just backfire.  There is a lot he'll be able to help with and just having him there will be huge.",false,false,t1_cstxstw,kadenz,,0,1436200396,t5_2r8fp,t3_3cavjf,t3_3cavjf,3,1437632268,0,0,cstxstw,Alzheimers,3,,
"Sorry to hear that, my grandfather was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease a week ago. He is at the early stage. The doctor give him curcumin as a dietary supplement and other medicine. I looked into it. It is a disease that may run in a family. I also found that in India there is a low morbidity of AD. It is because that Indian eat a lot of curry, whose main ingredient is turmeric. I decide to add more curry in my daily food. Moreover, I found the following helpful information on a website http://www.best-dietary-supplements.com/curcumin-11-benefits
A case report argues that turmeric is of importance if used to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD), a condition defined by memory loss and the intellectual abilities which are severe and have interfere with one daily life. The idea behind the concept is that, turmeric is rich of Aromatic (ar-) turmerone which in actual sense regenerate neural stem cells. This has the meaning that turmeric has proven to protect one against neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD). The turmerone is good in that it reverse the damage impacted by the disease by re-growing brain cells thus restoring the disease. Curcumin is one of the extract from turmeric which has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and ant-amyloid effects which is the cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Throughout the study, three patients who had reported of short-term memory loss, forgetfulness, disorientation of place and time, hallucination, agitation depression and dementia were put under the use of turmeric supplements. After being prescribed turmeric 764 mg/day (curcumin 100 mg/day) powder capsules treatment for 12 weeks, all the effects and symptoms were effectively reduced with no adverse effects. The medication was administered orally.

"I have a hard time faulting your mother in law.   It is heart breaking losing your partner.   THe person who you were once so relient upon for you support is gone.  While you can carry on a conversation, the sad truth is that alzheimers will often rob you of any empathy.  For some, being in denial is the only way they have to cope.

It is an impossible situation and the interim stage where a person can be trusted 90% of the time is really tricky becase you don't know how to react.

We utilize several GPS trackers.    My mom is usually good about taking her cell phone with her (which runs a tracking app).   However if all else fails - we have got a GPS trackers in shoes, watches, jackets....    Right now she wants independence and to be honest, it isn't worth the fight. 

Taking care of her is exhausting.   My father is doing a great job, but let's face it.  He needs to get away from it.  He needs to do his thing and he needs to have his own space.  Watching my mother 24/7 isn't a picnic and she isn't nearly at the point where she needs care.

Give your mother in law a break.  A scheduled day that she can plan to get away.   I go hang out with my mom every  Sunday.    We Garden, go for walks, chat, cook together...   My father gets to go do something normal.

We finally, after 6 months and three different specialists, have gotten the diagnosis. While no one was happy to hear it is Alzheimer's, it has been what everyone expected. 

Like everyone said, it's hard. I've watched my mom in half a year go from working, doing as she pleases, etc. to being unemployed and at the will of those around her. She is no longer allowed to drive, and was also suggested to not ride her bike by the doctor. When she heard that she broke down. Basically she just had her whole world ripped from her hands in under a year. We turned around and told her she could ride her bike, but just to be extra careful. 

The only way we are able to make it through this is with laughter. If she's having a bad day, find a way to turn it around and laugh about it. 

I do think you really need to focus on getting everything in order as soon as possible though. We've gotten both healthcare and financial poa in place, life insurance, etc. Just a suggestion, but what I'm doing with her is I've setup two checking accounts, I've for bills and one for spending. All direct deposits go to the bills checking account then I disperse the money between the two. It keeps her from needing to worry about factoring in bills when looking at how much money she has.

Another thought is creation of a memory book which can be referenced later.  There are many examples on the Internet. And while you are on the Internet, there is an Alzheimer's store. You may never need its products but it can provide you with some ideas about how to deal with memory loss.

"&gt; there are people in this world that want to do nice things for charities.


I looked at Alzheimer Scotland's page.

Climbing Kilimanjaro or running the North Pole Marathon isn't doing a nice thing for charity, it's blatant self promotion and attention seeking. 

Can you reasonably explain how time spent climbing a mountain would in any way be as good or better than sitting with someone who has dementia?

Nobody believes the people who claim they are losing 3 stone to raise awareness because one of their relatives was just diagnosed with muscular dystrophy. If they want to do something useful, then do their shopping or build muscle by carrying them around Glastonbury. No need for T shirts or web posts.

I consequently threw out his sheets, flipped his bed, and put a clean set on.

"My mom was put on an anti-depressant while still in early stages - Her doctor wanted to make sure that her memory problems were not the result of undiagnosed depression.

She lived with my sister, and after a couple of years had passed we talked one day about whether or not to continue the anti-depressant, as it had become crystal clear that her problems weren't related to depression.

But, once mom was completely off the anti-depressant, her temperament really went downhill, in that she got very snappish, testy, just all round confrontational and difficult.

So my sister went back to giving her the anti-depressant, and mom went back to being ok with things generally, accepting of help, direction, and all the other things necessary to keep her safe, healthy, clean, etc.

So, my personal experience is that medication can be something on the order of indispensable.

A really important concept in all this is that people with dementia are literally no longer capable of learning.

You can no more expect a dementia patient to ""grasp"" that they really do need the help than you would expect them to solve a problem in quantum physics.

That being the case, and it also being the case that the hostility, aggression, frustration, anxiety are painful not only for you, but for THEM, too, it's an act of mercy and kindness to make use of any tool that helps ease or eliminate those anxieties.
