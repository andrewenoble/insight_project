I'm sorry to rant but this is exactly the kind of ignorant bullshit every caregiver has to go through. You think she's the only one who gets stressed?

"Unfortunately, my mother came to live with me too late for me to ensure the disease was staved off by really good diet, exercise, stress free life and good nutrition - after huge research into  dementia, it seems that those 4 things really make a massive difference. 

I'm fanatical about coconut oil for myself and gave it to her too, and she really did seem to have much more energy which allowed her to exercise at a level that made a really difference, and she seemed to think much more clearly too. I also, interestingly, tried tiny very diluted doses of methylene blue (a key ingredient of a drug under trial a few years back that went nowhere despite seemingly pretty effective, probably because it is an old drug and there is no money in it for big pharmaceutical companies) and every time she had it she would start working on lists, organizing things, and doing sums.

"Interesting.

Here's the study: http://www.thelancet.com/action/showFullTextImages?pii=S2213-8587%2815%2900033-9

I don't subscribe to the Lancet so the full text is unavailable to me, but here's the interpretation:

&gt;Being underweight in middle age and old age carries an increased risk of dementia over two decades. Our results contradict the hypothesis that obesity in middle age could increase the risk of dementia in old age.

Underweightness is an issue, BUT look into the numbers and 

&gt;Compared with people of a healthy weight, underweight people (BMI &lt;20 kg/m2) had a 34% higher (95% CI 29–38) risk of dementia. Furthermore, the incidence of dementia continued to fall for every increasing BMI category, with very obese people (BMI &gt;40 kg/m2) having a 29% lower (95% CI 22–36) dementia risk than people of a healthy weight.

I don't have access to the exact numbers, can't look at the confounding factors, so all caveats apply, but this would be astoundingly different than the previously held consensus about obesity and dementia.

In case there are others interested, let me also respond to your other really great suggestions: She's not got to the incontinence stage, yet. But she has got to the stage where she thinks she is never here we we should be and is always trying to ""get home"". As bolts on doors, she's seriously damaged computers etc so I've tried bolts and padlocks on doors to stop that but she's broken them off, so I suppose I'd better go that route again and put on stronger ones :) Apropos meds, none of the GP/physician/geriatric specialist meds have been able to stop the afternoon panic attacks which run into violence and aggression by bedtime, and last to about 2am - the only thing I've found that works is, oddly, an over the counter anti-histamine ([Allergix](http://naturesown.co.za/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=42)) which a friend suggested I give her. 

I've always drawn a line for myself, that the day I have to tie her down or lock her in is the day I accept I cannot look after her any more. And I've been worrying that that day is coming.

"I want to share with you my experience as a live-in caregiver to a dementia patient.  Firstly, I work for my boyfriend's family, both he and I live with his grandmother and care for her.  She is incapable of doing anything on her own.  Anything.  That means, getting out of bed, in and out of the shower (which she is extremely combative and your dad will eventually become combative), the toilet, she can't even tell when she has to use the bathroom anymore, she has no concept of utensils or how to use a straw.  She talk jibberish and doesn't understand hardly anything you say to her.  She is literally, retarded.  Every morning my boyfriend and I wake up to her diaper full of shit and the overpowering smell of urine soaked all over her and the bedsheets... we struggle to get her out of bed to shower her.  Between getting her out of bed and into the shower we will be spat on, clawed, kicked at least 10 times, punched at least 20 times, hair pulled and yanked, she will grab the shower head and hit or spray us with it, she has been known to bite and I've been called a ""goddamn cunt"" by a once prudish woman more times than I can count.  So that's before breakfast.

Around lunch time she fights against eating.  She will hide her food in anything: sock drawer, under the sink in the bathroom, in a shoe, in the dog food bowls, in the closet, under the couch - in fact, she hides everything.  She just takes shit and fucking puts it I have no clue where because we'll rarely find whatever it is that's gone missing.  I once found a bit onion under the recliner.  So getting her to eat is hell.  She can sometimes be combative when trying to feed her, she spits her food out and of course cursing at us the whole time.

She cries all the time.  To manipulate someone into getting what she wants, she fake cries.  She cries if she doesn't like something, she cries because she doesn't know, she cries when we put Elvis on the record player.  

Taking her out is no longer something that can be done.  She is unstable in every aspect.  Her range of motion is slim to none; when she does decide she wants to walk, it's assisted.  She cannot walk on her own anymore because she has physically deteriorated and falls from not being able to maintain balance.  She's fallen several times; broke her arm, her hip and has had knots on her head from what I call plank-falling, where she just stiffens up and falls back.  

It isn't easy taking care of someone who is deteriorating, reversing in age to mental and physical retardation and who is a constant rollercoaster of emotion.  Its tiring.  This will no doubt ruin a person's sanity.  

All that said, I think your mom is probably doing her best but her absolute best cannot be achieved without help.  She needs someone assist her and to be there so she can spend time away from your dad.  Its especially difficult for her that this is her husband. A man she's spent X amount of years growing up with, loving, fighting and parenting.  There's a lot of emotion your mom is going through.  Imagine, your lover, your life partner slipping away in a violent spell, right before your eyes and there's nothing you can do but watch... how torturous!  Its a harsh, aggressive and cruel disease.  It's heartbreaking.  I suggest you talk to your mom about finding a nurse's aid to be there with your mom.  There are groups that will come to your house and sit for hours with your dad so that outside tasks can be done or just to give your mom some space.  Do your best to not be so bitter toward your mom.  This isn't fair to anyone but you've got to have compassion and understanding to fight through this.",false,false,t1_cqdqjs4,cosmicberryfairypie,,0,1429141468,t5_2rfqf,t3_32qen1,t3_32qen1,4,1432414699,0,0,cqdqjs4,dementia,4,,

You may have to resort to the keyed deadbolts which all use the same key—but if she's still strong enough to break them off, wow. My mom was so little (as was I *then*!) that I could pick her up and carry her like a baby after she broke her hip, which was repaired, but she eventually refused to do the physical therapy to keep herself ambulatory. So I can't imagine having to care for someone that strong. I always thought that I was lucky it was my mother rather than my father that I had to look after.

"Sorry about your mother. My father suffers from bvFTD as well. We estimate he has had it for about a decade but his official diagnosis was a little over three years ago. 

In my father's experience, his long term memory is still intact even as his motor functions deteriorate. He is aware that he lives in a nursing home but doesn't seem to notice that his best friend there has Alzheimer's or that he is surrounded by dementia patients. He tells me he is going to escape but is fearful of the guards who stand watch (there are no guards, only locked doors). The puzzling part is that he will struggle to remember if he ate dinner but if I tell my dad that I'm going to Disney tomorrow, he will ask me several days later if I had fun at Disney. 

Be prepared to watch your mom have odd physical gestures and verbal tics that you would never expect. My father would say inappropriate things and do vulgar motions while in public. I'm sure you are already experiencing this but try to be patient. They don't understand that they are doing anything wrong so reasoning will not work with them. Imagine an adult sized toddler except the toddler understands the word ""no"". 

Start looking for assisted living facilities now. Wait lists are often very long and securing payment for them can be an exhausting process as well. My father went from being able to be alone for an hour or two to needing constant care what felt like overnight. He would wait for me to fall asleep and then go raid the kitchen at night.  My husband and I were worried that he would start a fire trying to cook something. I forget the breaking point but we were incredibly lucky to find a home with a bed within two weeks (most places put us on a two year wait list). 

Feel free to pm me or peruse my history on here. I've posted several times about my experience with this illness and my father's condition. Be patient and make the most of the present with your mom.

"&gt;Millions of people get Alzheimer's and their spouses don't all act like this.

In all fairness to your mom, how could you possibly know what the spouses of millions of dementia patients do or don't do in the privacy of their homes 24/7?

She still loves your father, but every day your father becomes more and more like some bizarre stranger to her, a stranger with some very difficult behavior, and there's no way out for either of them—one is not responsible for his continuing mental changes and the other is not responsible for the terrible grief she feels watching her life partner deteriorate before her eyes.

Unfortunately, most of the help available costs money. Can your mom be persuaded to see a doctor or therapist on a regular basis who might be able to help her with her issues? Have you searched on http://www.alz.org to see if there is a chapter in your location? Even if not, they have an online forum where people can vent and also help each other—feeling that one is not alone in this role can be soothing. Is institutionalizing your father out of the question? Because maybe it's time.

Good luck to you and your family.

"&gt;  but tries to excuse it by saying nobody has any idea what she's going through 24/7, etc. 

If it's just the two of them living 24/7, then she's right and she's also scared about her own future.
