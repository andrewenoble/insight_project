"As someone tangentially connected to the Alzheimer's research world...

I think it was a bit overoptimistic. It did mention that many drugs similar to the ones profiled have failed trials, and it did mention that we don't actually know what causes the disease. But it kind of glossed over those points.

Also FWIW I think the Biogen drug is at least semi promising. They seem to be doing a decent job of fixing operational issues that past clinical trials faced, and they're using big fucking doses even though that risks side effects.

This is a perfect example of why you cannot be trusted. Your a double talker. You talk out of both sides of you mouth. Instead of staying on topic, You constantly change, switch, or move the conversation slightly in a different direction. **This is deceptive behavior by you.** 

Your example abstracts are misleading. Thousands of things can go wrong or be misinterpreted in the types of studies you show as positive proof for your theories. They prove nothing, because they are not 3 Phase Double Blind studies. You did say your studies have been criticized by scientist. The you go on to say, ""but they have never provided convincing evidence that the studies were wrong."" **This is another false statement made by you.** Because you had already admitted that, quote ""scientists have pointed out flaws in the evidence that I present (too small a study, no placebo, not randomized, etc.)"" end quote. Scientist have provided convincing evidence. YOU JUST REFUSE TO SEE IT. 

You keep saying that your hypothesis are supported by reputable scientist. **This is another one of your deceptive statements.** Because, you then shockingly admitted that you have pissed off the Medical and Medical scientific community and they do not what to have anything to do with you anymore. So......Who and Where are these reputable scientist that agree with your hypothesis?????

Several scientist pointed out many of your errors and inconsistencies and shot you theory out the window, but again, YOU REFUSED TO SEE IT.   

You also said you have given several scientific talks. Where? Who was your audience? Since you called them ""scientific talks,"" that would lead people to believe that you gave these talks to people in the sciencetific community. Since you claim to have given several ""scientific talks"", I would think in this day and age surely a few, or at the very least 1 or 2, of you ""scientific talks"" were video taped. Where's the video. Where is the evidence that you gave these ""scientific talks""???

The results from 12 and 26 weeks have not been released but there is at least one hint as to the drug's effectiveness.

""A minimum dose of 14 mg of ANAVEX 2-73 seem to be required to achieve a therapeutic effect and to keep MMSE score unchanged.""

This suggests that MMSE scores can be kept unchanged by the drug.

And from the recent article:


PATIENTS have woken up from some of the most devastating impacts of Alzheimer’s disease, regaining the ability to play sport, paint and enjoy time with family, after a world-first drug trial in Melbourne.

The remarkable results have fuelled hopes among doctors of the first major improvement in treating the horror disease since the 1990s.

Pianist Pauline Stevens has regained the ability to play the piano after being placed on the experimental Anavex 2-73 drug trial at Caulfield Hospital.

Award-winning artist ­Valerie Lynch has also rediscovered the ability to paint after beginning the medication, stunning her doctors, family and friends.

When Melbourne was selected as the first city in the world to test Anavex a year ago, lead researcher Associate Professor Steve Macfarlane had no idea how much of an impact it would make.

“They seem to be significantly improved in terms of what they can do. It is function that has improved and in many cases mood as well,” Prof Macfarlane said.

“To me, seeing real improvements to patients is much more important than seeing a statistically significant improvement on a rating scale.

Two negatives: Macfarlane has been accused of over-touting another Alzheimer's drug in the past (Pbt2) and his comments seem to suggest that after a period of time at least there is no further improvement in cognition.  However, the combination of 5 week results and his current observations seems to indicate that Anavex 2-73 improves functions of daily living in people with Alzheimer's disease.",,,,Lane_Simonian,,,1461462420,t5_2r8fp,t3_4g4zbg,t3_4g4zbg,0,1463649246,0,0,d2ewq7q,Alzheimers,0,,

None of this proves that peroxynitrite causes Alzheimer's disease but it links peroxynitrite damage to some of the central features of the disease including tau tangles and to the inhibition of the transport of choline and its conversion into acetylcholine.

Anavex 2-73 may inhibit the interaction between PSD-95 and neuronal nitric oxide synthase.  If it does this, it would lead to a decline in production of peroxynitrite (ONOO-).

"APOE stands for apolipoprotein e. It's job in the body is to transport cholesterol.  It's also a gene that's associated with risk of Alzheimer’s disease  (AD).  There are 4 common variations of APOE alleles.  Apoe e2, Apoe e3, and Apoe e4.  Everyone gets 2 apoe alleles, one from each parent so the possible combinations are 2/2, 2/3, 3/3, 3/4, and 4/4.  3 is the most prevalent and 3/3 is the most common genotype.

The 3 is neutral for AD risk, the 2 is protective, the 4 is risky. 

PET scans on healthy people show that 4/4s begin to deposit amyloid protein in the brain (which can lead to AD) in their 20s.  While 2/2s basically never do. 3/3s in their 50s.  The 2/3s, and 3/4s fall in between.

Despite all of this, anyone can get AD, and not all 4/4s will get AD...its not ""deterministic"". Plus, research shows that 4/4s stand to gain the most from risk mitigation (eating lots of fish, getting good sleep, not having depression have been proven in population studies.  Other factors that I suspect will eventually be shown through research to be more protective in 4/4s are exercise, not being obese or hypertensive in midlife).  

All of the risk factors I've mentioned are well established in the medical literature to be associated with Alzheimer’s risk.

The other genes are very rare, causal, familial and deterministic.  If you have the gene you will get AD and you'll get it early / young.  Most families already know about it because at least one member in each generation will have had AD in their 40s or 50s.  These are the Presinilin genes and interestingly they were discovered to have been brought to the new world with the Spanish conquistadores.  

Do you happen to live in Illinois? I work at a hospital that does these tests and helps patients reduce as many risk factors for AD as possible to delay or prevent the disease.  There are similar places around the US too.  If you tell me what state your in (if US) I can see if you're close to one.

Heat-processed ginseng enhances the cognitive function in patients with moderately severe Alzheimer's disease.
Heo JH, Lee ST, Chu K, Oh MJ, Park HJ, Shim JY, Kim M.
Abstract
OBJECTIVES:
Ginseng has been reported to improve cognitive function in animals and in healthy and cognitively impaired individuals. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of a heat-processed form of ginseng that contains more potent ginsenosides than raw ginseng in the treatment of cognitive impairment in patients with moderately severe Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS:
Forty patients with AD were randomized into one of three different dose groups or the control group as follows: 1.5 g/day (n = 10), 3 g/day (n = 10), and 4.5 g/day (n = 10) groups, or control (n = 10). The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were used to assess cognitive function for 24 weeks.
RESULTS:
The treatment groups showed significant improvement on the MMSE and ADAS. Patients with higher dose group (4.5 g/day) showed improvements in ADAS cognitive, ADAS non-cognitive, and MMSE score as early as at 12 weeks, which sustained for 24-week follow-up.
DISCUSSION:
These results demonstrate the potential efficacy of a heat-processed form of ginseng on cognitive function and behavioral symptoms in patients with moderately severe AD.

A 24-week randomized open-label study with Korean red ginseng (KRG) showed cognitive benefits in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. To further determine long-term effect of KRG, the subjects were recruited to be followed up to 2 yr. Cognitive function was evaluated every 12 wk using the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) and the Korean version of the Mini Mental Status Examination (K-MMSE) with the maintaining dose of 4.5 g or 9.0 g KRG per d. At 24 wk, there had been a significant improvement in KRG-treated groups. In the long-term evaluation of the efficacy of KRG after 24 wk, the improved MMSE score remained without significant decline at the 48th and 96th wk. ADAS-cog showed similar findings. Maximum improvement was found around week 24. In conclusion, the effect of KRG on cognitive functions was sustained for 2 yr follow-up, indicating feasible efficacies of long-term follow-up for Alzheimer’s disease.

Again, you can believe what you want to believe and certainly one can criticize the studies, but at the very least the studies indicate that there is the possibility of a permanent but limited improvement in certain cognitive functions in people with Alzheimer's disease.

Note: ginseng may at least in the short-term increase blood pressure.  The side effects of long-term ginseng use have not been evaluated.

"I think coming at it from a teamwork perspective will help. Rather than ""dad, you need to convince her to go to the doctor"" try ""we're all worried, and want to help you and mom as much as possible. The sooner we figure out what's going on, the better it will be."" It's overwhelming and scary, especially for the spouse- so if you guys can ease some of the pressure of the testing etc, he may not be in such denial. 

Depending on her doctor, if you call and share this info, they may do a MMSE during her next exam. Some doctors will say ""we respect patient privacy and don't discuss our client's medical status"" but some offices will be like ""okay, let me talk to the doctor. Maybe he can bring it up during the next exam."" Also, if you weren't aware- some forms of dementia can be caused by low vitamin B12, untreated hypothyroid, etc. 

It's very important that they address it sooner rather than later, but I'm sure you know that. Maybe he doesn't, now that I'm thinking about it. There is new medication that can slow the progression of the disease substantially, and he might not be aware of that. The sooner they figure out a game plan (assisted living, staying at home, when to draw the line with staying at home, finances), the better. 

Your mom is probably aware that something is wrong. In the early stages, people start to understand that they aren't functioning normally, but are afraid and embarrassed, and yes they may be in denial also. If you bring it up with her, again, do it from a place of love and cooperation. 

Anecdotally, I know someone who got her parent to go by saying ""let's figure out why you're having these glitches, so we can fix them."" Never mentioned dementia or Alzheimer's, just ""glitches."" Maybe you could convince them by framing it as something simple like ""it could be something that's easy to fix, let's check, just for peace of mind.""

If you are allowed to take her somewhere the things you do don't need to be costly, some of our favorite things to do are feeding ducks at a local park or a quick walk in nature.  If her room or a common area has a nice window you might buy a few humming bird feeders. The nursing home would most likely not balk at providing the sugar and water to fill them (though you might need to do the work) as the cost is negligible and can be hidden in the food budget, but often new purchases for things like a bird feeder don't often get approved. Don't forget the importance of touch. A hug, a pat on the back, a hand massage all go a long way.

My father was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's when he was 50 years old. What you're describing sounds quite a bit like this. The best thing would be for you/one of your family members to take him to see his GP and have a cognitive exam done. Additionally try to keep an open mind about this and if he forgets about something don't make him feel bad about it and try to help him as much as possible.

"The drug being tested in Colombia is crenezumab by Genentech--the same one that showed about a 30 percent slowing of the decline in cognitive function in early Alzheimer's patients (Eli Lilly's solanezumab produced very similar results).  Biogen's aducanumab--yet another amyloid antibody--showed about an 80% slowing of the decline in the highest dose group.  However about a third of the patients with the APOE4 gene dropped out of the trial due to adverse effects including brain swelling.  People with the APOE4 gene usually progress more rapidly in early Alzheimer's disease than people without the gene.  So first of all, Biogen was comparing apples to oranges--a placebo group where almost all the patients with the APOE4 gene were still in the trial with the drug group where a third of the patient group had dropped out of the trial.  To make matters worse, they carried the results of the APOE4 dropouts forward so they were reporting cognitive levels at say six months as if they were the cognitive levels at one year.  A lower dose with fewer dropouts produced results in line with Genentech and Eli Lilly's drugs for Alzheimer's disease.

A thirty percent slowing in the rate of decline at the early stages of Alzheimer's disease with perhaps no improvements in functions of daily living may be considered statistically significant but may not be significant to a person's life.  PBS over-touted the results from the anti-amyloid antibody trials.

"Hi there. First and foremost, take a deep breath and go someplace quiet and relaxing for a few minutes each day.  Allow yourself to make mistakes. There is no rule book for life, you are doing the best you can. 
  
My SO has Alzheimer's disease.  It's not easy and the dynamic is different than a parent and child. I have no idea if your DH has early onset AD and no one here can tell you if he does, but it sounds like it might be time to get a doctor involved. These symptoms can be caused by almost anything (stress, medication, dehydration testosterone level changes etc) so a doctor visit is key. 
  
My SO was adamant there was nothing wrong. Anytime I brought up the subject he got angry or shut down. I called his GP and asked for a call back. I explained the situation and set up an appointment.  I did this without my SO's knowledge. I may have taken the low road, but I don't regret it. I put the appointment on the calendar as I would with all Doctor appointments. He just assumed it was s follow up. I was in the waiting room when the doctor sent for me. He told me (in front of SO) that as part of a routine physical he provided a memory test and my SO failed. He then asked me to record a second memory test using my phone. The simple test used three random words that were told to my SO and then the Doctor would distract my SO by asking a few questions like what did you do yesterday etc. then ask my SO to repeat the words. It's not too difficult but my SO only remembered one word. We left with a referral to a neurologist and my SO didn't respond badly when being told this was a problem by someone other than me. That video came in handy two weeks later when my SO no longer remembered the Doctor appointment, test, or agreeing to see the neurologist.  Once again, this is our story, you DH may not have AD. Don't worry about making too many far reaching plans yet, take it one day at a time. 
  
If I was having the specific argument you laid out with my SO, I would buy another toothbrush. Someone on this sub put it better than I ever could when they said to live with a person who has AD you have to live in their world. They aren't able to make it to yours. I find the easiest way with repetitive arguments is to avoid when you can and forget changing them, change the environment, or the item, or the way I approach things.  
  
The one thing I would do before visiting the Doctor (if I could turn back time) is get long term care insurance. Making sure the policy covers home care and assisted living. 

I hope that all of this helps in some way.  Remember to take **some** time for yourself every day. I mean every day. It can be done, you just have to make a firm line and not cross it. This is vital to dealing with stressful lives like you have described. Reach out any time with a PM even if it's just to vent.

""Those working and playing with Mark had a special knowledge, the secret of his superhuman power to get things done. It was simple: generosity of spirit, intellect and effort, all hidden under a legendary sense of humor and love of life. Mark supported everyone around him, from senior professor to beginning high school student, by instilling a confidence that everyone could contribute to improving the world if they had the courage to follow their data and more importantly, their intuition. Certainly if a coal miner’s son could be a leading scientist, it was not pedigree but perspiration and heart that would propel one forward. This knowledge permeated and touched everyone, even those that knew him only as a reviewer or meeting attendee, for it is rare for scientists to support total strangers.""

"It's funny how you never really confront the relevant issues that I bring up in these discussions. You just go off on another tangent in a different direction. You disguise your true motives by telling me I have made unfair and cruel accusations. Give us all a break. I seriously doubt that you have a deep understanding of empathy. I have not seen a great deal of empathy in any of your post. I have seen you boosting yourself up with a lot of nice writings by important people. I see you avoiding confronting relevant issues, I see you trying to convince people you are right just because you are intelligent. Also, when you do give an example of what you believe are positive results of your concoctions, they are so poor. I have a very intelligent cousin that has such a twisted since of himself that he will never be able to admit he is wrong about anything. You remind me a great deal of him.

&gt;my mother for example could recognize her home again, she stopped having delusions, she could recognize some objects and remember her name again, and was much more alert and aware

Funny thing, my mother is the same way now. Some days she does not recognize her home, some days she forgets her name, some days she has delusions, and then some days she recognizes her home and knows her name and is much more alert and aware. This is the natural ebb and flow of Alzheimer disease. Some days are simply better than others.

When It is obvious that someone such as yourself is trying to prey on the desperation of people looking for anything to help so you can have access to free guinea pigs is beyond despicable. Again, I will remind you that your concoctions could, and I am sure in some cases, would cause harm to people. You have NEVER even expressed this as a possibility. This is **Totally 
Irresponsible** and shows a definite lack of empathy. You are so convinced that you are such a nice person and this is justification for using people and spreading false hope.

Feeding the cat difficult to remember which everything else, buy a [pet feeder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0016BVY2U/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awd_JQNexbEZP8VTE) and fill it once a week.

This allows it to be used for any reason instead of emergencies. He uses it when he feels scared and lonely (I'm normally just in the other room but he can't see me so he doesn't know this) and we talk through the button and I keep him calm while I make my way to him. 

Swallowing becomes an issue with people with AD. It can cause aspiration pneumonia and choking so you should be mindful of it.  Start sneaking in easy to eat foods now so it's easier to transition later and you already know what they like. (Yogurt for breakfast, puddings for dessert, etc)

Make time for yourself. The first year I was a caregiver I didn't go to the doctor for myself once. I went to multiple doctors, multiple times that year for him. My friendships suffered which is a cyclical thing as I had less free time and opportunity to make new friends as well.  
   
Do not expect AD behavior to be changeable.  You have to start things early because the longer a person has AD the less likely they will be able to make new memories. Things like the emergency button only work if the person with AD remembers to use it, and teaching them once the disease has a firm grip on them will be an exercise in futility. 
If they do something upsetting, it can be less stressful to do what you can to avoid it than expect them to be able to change. 
  
Be open to learning new ways of doing things as you never know what you can learn.

For scientists who support the peroxynitrite hypothesis for neurodegenerative disease see Perry, Sultana, Beckman, and Radi among others.  If interested read this relatively comprehensive review of the potential role of peroxynitrite in health and disease.

Your attempts to single me out as a obsessive/compulsive and delusional lone wolf has to stop.  Whether anything you have to say about me personally is remotely true or not is completely irrelevant.

The only thing that really matters is whether the small-scale clinical trials which suggest (not prove) that some permanent improvements in elements of cognitive function can be achieved in someone with Alzheimer's disease are true or not.  You are right on this one point--phase three clinical trials are needed to come to this conclusion.  On the other hand, if several small-scale clinical trials using similar compounds acting through the same mechanism produce very similar results then the scales tip more in my favor than they do in yours.

Sad to say, the current alternative involves using drugs that provide either symptomatic relief early on or are of very limited effectiveness for a awhile followed by a difficult progression to death (for the person with the disease and for their loved ones) or trying natural compounds with possible side effects that produced positive, albeit not certain results in small-scale clinical trials.  I understand it is not much of a choice, but it may be a decade or more before another choice exists.",,,,Lane_Simonian,,,1459724802,t5_2r8fp,t3_4cqaqb,t1_d1oim8q,1,1463197600,0,0,d1omfp8,Alzheimers,1,,
"This is very, very similar to my case. The only difference is that my father was already diagnosed and in theory ""knows"" he is sick. 

But it happens exactly the same way you described, he forgets things/situations/actions (that he insists to perform, because they are ""simple things"") until he forgets to do them and lashes on us (""I never said that"", ""you never told me that"", ""I didn't do that"", etc).

The advice I received here (and that now I pass to you) is that you bring a close friend or relative; brother/sister, cousin, uncle/aunt. Somebody that he respects but DOESN'T see or live with on a daily basis.

I total stranger (counselor/medic) will hardly reach him at all, but somebody very close to him, with whom he spends his daily life will be even worse. And that means your Mom, sister and you. 

Because the symptoms slowly grew around you all, now there is a very strong resentment between what any of you say about this subject. You need to bring someone from outside, that won't be painted by his bias of ""years complaining about me"".

"Very sweet of you to volunteer. My wife has AD and I find that most people shrink away because they don't understand or don't want to deal with the behavior.

Here's a paperback I bought. Only so-so for my case, but might be of help to you. Bless you.
