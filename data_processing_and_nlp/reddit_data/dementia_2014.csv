"Ok, so I'm glad to know what your agenda is.

There is no shortage of data about Dementia on the internet, and many organizations such as yours exist.  What would be the point of subscribing to yours?  In looking through the various sections in it, I have seen nothing that is new.

People who have dementia and those caring for them are very often in dire emotional straits and desperate, and thus easily duped if the selling job is good enough. I feel we here at reddit and in this subreddit specifically have a duty keep our eyes open for real and prospective snake oil sales pitches.

Having said all that, how about you write about some curative methodologies, such as I did?

Personally I use Smart Drugs (Nootropics), Nutrition, Prescribed Medication and other Brain Stimulation Therapies (CES, tDCS, tA/DCS) to help me fight this disease.

As regards your relative that is in the final stages, try them on organic coconut oil, 2-6 tablespoons a day, you may be very surprised.

Your doctor will likely give him a memory test and recommend him to a specialist if they see something that does not seem normal. If your doctor comes to the conclusion that he does have a form of dementia, and the wandering behavior persists you should register your husband with the local police department.

"I'm sorry you and your family are going through this. My father suffers from FTD (behavioral variant) and nothing has been easy. There isn't much I can say that hasn't been said. My father was diagnosed in 2012 but I'm pretty sure he's had it for at least  8 years. The days I thought were the hardest two years ago pale in comparison to now. Your father's laugh might be out of place but try to enjoy it. My father lost his ability to smile, laugh, or even cry. He can still talk but his emotions are mostly grunts and he is in a constant blank stare. There is no telling what else he will lose as the disease progresses. 

Start checking with nursing homes now because some facilities will have wait lists of 2 years or more. Men are also harder to place at times. They are ridiculously expensive so it is never too early to get his finances together. 

Find a support network. This can be friends, family, or a local caregiver support group, whatever. Please talk to people about what is happening. My mother was the primary caregiver and until recently she has kept my father's condition a secret. How she lasted is beyond me. Personally, I had a hard time finding people who could relate. I'm in my late twenties and none of my friends have gone through anything like this. I'm happy for them but it was a relief to talk to people who had been in my shoes.

"You are not alone.  He is not alone.  I'd suggest checking out www.alz.org.  It's the national Alzheimer's Association webpage.  Check out support groups in your area.  This will be a huge help to talk to people who are in your same shoes and his same shoes.  

You are correct.  The disease is nasty but remember, it's most hard on the family.  The person going through the disease usually has no idea what is going on (except in the beginning stages where they know they aren't remembering like they used to but can't put their finger on it).  

Nursing homes aren't the worst place for people with dementia.  Honestly, I'd rather see someone in a nursing home where the care takers are only there for 8-12 hours at a time then get to go home, whereas if your loved one stays with you, it's a 24 hour job for you/your dad.  There's no leaving the house, what if grandma gets out.  You could have home health come in if you want to go that route though.  Check out nursing homes again, if it gets to that point where grandma can't live alone.  The federal and state government regulate nursing homes highly.  Check out Nursing Home Compare (http://www.medicare.gov/nursinghomecompare/search.html) to see how local nursing homes in the area score.  5 stars is the best.  Just because a home is 2-3 stars doesn't mean it's horrible.  Just means they had a few rough surveys.  It could mean the home is shit though too.  It takes roughly three-four years to get a home back up to 4-5 stars after being low.  Kind of like a GPA...easy to bring it down, hard to bring it up.  So if you see a home that's a low rating, but when you visit, you love it, go with your gut.  When you visit, feel free to ask them about their survey results.  It's public knowledge.  They even have to have their survey papers where the public can reach/read them if they wish.    

Sometimes the disease is quick acting.  I've seen where people are living independently, then go to an assisted living for a few months, then go to a nursing home and pass away all within a year of living alone.  Then I've seen people in the nursing home for over 5-10 years.  It's such a crazy disease.  It doesn't affect anybody the same.  

Assisted living: the care takers will assist with medications and possibly getting ready for the day/bed, etc, meals are typically provided.

Nursing home: the care takers can and will do everything for the resident if they need it.  Take them to the bathroom, change their clothes, put on TED hose, push them down the mall, provide all three meals plus snacks, feed them meals if the resident needs it.  Some Alzheimer's secure units do require the resident to feed themselves, but others are more relaxed.  If the resident can't function properly on the regular nursing home floor, they'll keep the in the secure unit for safety (if resident wonders is usually a huge one for why they'd stay in the secure unit).  Just be aware if you bring your grandma to a nursing home and she is in a locked unit, there may be the possibility of her moving to the 'regular' skilled floor if her needs of care become too heavy for the secure unit.  (Wondering is considered a 'behavior' but it's not a bad behavior to exhibit in a secure unit.  Most of the time the resident has no clue where they are and just want to see whats going on around them.  Sometimes they're looking to go home.)

"Often people recommend distracting them from desires that they can't carry out. Usually with white lies. The classic example is an elderly patient who is asking about or wanting to see their partner who has passed away many years ago.

The strategy involves soothing them with vaguely affirmative tones, and then redirecting their desire. So in the case of the partner that has passed away, you say ""They're not here at the moment, but they should be coming back soon,"" or ""They just went out to get something, they said they would be right back"".

It might be hard since your grandmother is used to being very active, but it could definitely help to calm her down. You could try saying ""We can't go out right now, but we're going for a hike later on!"" or ""We're not ready right now, but our hike is planned for 2 hours from now"" - depending on how short her short-term memory is (probably surprisingly short). If you're soothing and you calm her and assure her that she can get out of the house soon, she'll usually calm down. It will feel awful lying - and that's a normal feeling - but it really is the best thing you can do for you and your family. 

She will continue to try to get out, since its part of her habit. Just remember that her emotions aren't like ours, she won't remember any quarrel she has about being locked up after a short while. So the best thing you can do is to keep her safe, and when she gets upset placate her and redirect her.

"Oh man, I have had so many of those conversations with my dad. He was always a funny man, and god has allowed me to see glimpses of that funny, proud dad he once was.

This last summer I was interning for a senators office and had to wear a suit to work each day. I went to visit him one evening (he lives in a memory care home) and when I walked up he exclaimed ""Holy Shit! You work here now?!""

It was comical because he no longer knows my name, yet he recognizes me still. I graduate from college in a few months, and it is weird to think he won't be there, but I am so thankful for those little comments that remind me of the funny comments he used to make.

"I work in a program with a lot of individuals with dementia, Cerebral palsy, Intellectual Disabilities, etc.  We have two rooms for meals, one that is more social, and the other a quiet room.  The idea for the quiet room is that many patients have dysphagia or aspiration precautions and need a distraction free environment.  If they are eating and have food in their mouth (prone to pocketing or what have you) and you're trying to speak with them, or they're distracted by your presence they are much more likely to choke, aspirate, etc. 

Feeding clients with dementia can be a struggle, and often people will forget or refuse to eat.  I can understand the Program Director's POV in that nutrition and routine are probably the more important aspects of care, and by your presence this can further confuse patients.

Hello Unicorn,
I'm sorry you're going through this, today must've been so painful.  You are not useless, there are things you can do, not least be there for your Dad. Company means a lot at these times even if there is nothing concrete that can be done.
 
Dementia progresses differently for different patients. It's very common though not inevitable in the later stages to lose the ability to walk, which maybe what precipitated the falls.  Other features of later stage dementia are confusion and agitation, remember at the moment she is possibly in pain, in a strange, confusing and overwhelming environment and though hospital is the safest place for her until she stabilises those things will amplify her symptoms and distress. Inability to communicate, and gradually the complete loss of language is common, this will often come and go with 'flashes'  of clarity.  Even when she is unable to respond she may still understand what is said or react to a familiar voice or friendly tone.  She may have already lost interest in food, she may forget to eat or how to, eventually she may be unable to swallow and will be in danger of choking.  All these things will make her more frail and susceptible to infections especially respiratory ones.  She will probably become incontinent.

The worst he is telling you to prepare for is I imagine your Nan's possibly imminent death, though there is a reasonable chance she will rally and return to her slow decline.  I'm not in a position to comment on whether this would be a good thing for her or your family and a lot depends on how good the care home is and how much time family members can spend with her. She may have previously made her views clear on how hard she wants the Doctor's to fight to keep her going and under what circumstances and if not your family may be discussing it with her doctors now. If the decision is taken not to prolong her life unnecessarily it doesn't mean that all medical attention is withdrawn, they will still treat pain etc and make her as comfortable as possible but they won't be doing any invasive or traumatic procedures, chest compressions and electric shocks to restart her heart if she has a heart attack for instance or put in a feeding tube if she can't eat.

There are things you can do to improve the quality of life she has left, little comforting things like; holding and gently stroking her hand, brushing her hair, talking to her even if she doesn't reply or reading her the bible if she was into that, playing her music from her youth, spraying a scent she likes into the air (it's usually lavender, most people find it comforting).  

Again, I'm sorry your family is going through this, give your Dad a big hug from me.",false,true,t1_ceupa5c,BigSisLil,,0,1390269467,t5_2rfqf,t3_1vpje3,t3_1vpje3,9,1432031909,0,0,ceupa5c,dementia,9,,,
"The best advice I can give you is to tune it out.  A couple of games you can play is to (quietly, in your thoughts) assign points to her threats and terrible comments.  The worse her language, the more points she gets.  There is absolutely no way you can change her behavior, and short of leaving the job, you are going to continue to be exposed to this.  The only thing you can control is how it makes you feel.  I've been working in human services for a couple decades now and I've been called some pretty hilarious things.  I've been in some terrible situations too, and I learned over time to just let it bounce off.  It is tough, so use little tricks to make it easier.
Another trick is to not let yourself feel relief when the job goes easy.  It is MUCH easier to disconnect from a good situation than from a bad one until you get the hang of it.
Finally, write down some of the really awful things she says, and later, with a trusted person, read them.  You will get a bit of sympathy at worst and a huge laugh at best.
Good luck!

Over the course of the morning I drank 3 cups of coffee each with a teaspoon of the stuff.

1. After the first dose, I felt sufficiently mentally awake (as opposed to the more usual brain fog) to leave off taking my Provigil, Piracetam, Aniracetam, and putting on any nicotine patches, and engaging in a tDCS session.  This has continued throughout the day.

2.  I suffer from chronic arthritis pain in my elbows, wrists, finger joints, hips and knees.  I get relief by taking Mobic twice a day and Ibuprofen and Vicodin if it is really bad.  This makes that I have difficulty doing physical work and walking anything more than 100yds.

With taking the oil my pain reduced within 30 minutes to the point where I have not found it necessary to take any painkillers yet.  I also was able to take our Pug for a walk around the periphery of our 4.7 acre plot (at least half a mile).

After the third cup of coffee with the oil, I stopped.

I have not felt hungry thus far today, which is unusual.

If anyone is interested, I intend to continue taking the oil for about a week, and will report every now and then as to my status.

All in all I have not felt this alert, pain free and motivated in months.

"Does she go to a regular doctor? Does your father have her healthcare proxy? 

He should make an appointment with her primary care physician, ostensibly for a ""wellness visit"" as they now call it, to check normal aging conditions like blood pressure, cholesterol, etc. If neither of them sees a physician regularly, he can say he's also going for a similar checkup, that way your mother won't feel as if this is some ploy to get her into the doctor's office to face what she is probably quite terrified of facing. If he has her healthcare proxy he can fax it to the doctor and then explain to her, hopefully by phone, about your mother's memory problems and ask her to give your mother the very informal in-office memory test as if it were a regular part of the wellness visit. One can hope that the doc will take it from there. Frequently the next stop is a neurologist so that there can be a more precise diagnosis.

NO ONE wants to face the knowledge that her mind is going, so sending her reading materials telling her what the signs of memory loss are will likely be as unwelcome as your dad's or neighbor's hints. Believe me, she knows something is wrong but she is quite understandably in denial.

"I would personally have a problem with this, and question the decision to admit her to a psych hospital. 

My MIL has a history of mental illness and had been hospitalized in a psych facility in the past. Around age 72, she was hallucinating and we thought she was having another psychotic episode. We took her to the ER, thinking that they'd admit her to a psych hospital again. Instead, they diagnosed her with a UTI -- and dementia. A course of antibiotics cleared up the UTI and stopped her hallucinations. However she was still exhibiting dementia /memory problems. It was recommended at that time she needed to be in a long-term memory care unit. 

I asked the doctors this very question: what is the difference between a psychotic episode, and dementia? Why would they not simply but her back on the psych meds, like in times past? And I was told that there is a ""fuzzy"" line, and that after a certain age, psych meds are not recommended. I find it all confusing. Was she mentally ill all those years in midlife, or did she actually have early stages of dementia? 

There's another added layer in that MIL was dx'ed with mild epilepsy back in her teens. The meds used to treat that are similar to what is used to treat some mental illnesses. So what is the difference? When MIL's dementia symptoms worsen, her seizures also worsen. Is her dementia caused by a lifetime of seizures?

"I'm kind of going through the same thing with my mom. Before my dad passed away in February, he was becoming concerned. At some point, I'm not sure when, he had her examined by a doctor (he didn't tell the reason for seeing the doctor...I think he just gave an explanation of something along the lines of a routine check up) and the diagnosis was vascular dementia. As I understand it, though, even if the diagnosis comes back as memory impaired, it wouldn't be something for her to be informed of and somehow get her to accept; it would be for your dad and you so that you both can work on a plan for how to move forward, care providing, finding resources/information best suited for her particular situation, and such. Neither my brother nor myself, nor any of our extended family, have tried to tell her that she is memory impaired since it would almost certainly be fruitless. She *does* admit to being absent minded, but that's pretty much the extent of it.

Don't be so hard on yourself.  Dementia is a disease that you have absolutely zero control over.  It is wonderful that you want to be there for your Nana and you should be - but only to the point where it does not destroy your life.  You have a right to live also.  Unless you're the primary caregiver, limit your interaction with her.  Yes, as you stated she was there for you through difficult times for you and you seem to realize and appreciate that which is a lot more than many people would do.  However, that was in the past.  Life is in the present and your life counts just as much as everyone else's and that includes Nana's.

"This sounds a lot like institutionalised abuse- ie, forcing people to follow the timetable that is convenient to the home as opposed to giving them choice and supporting them to do what they want. 

I agree it sounds that in this case it is potentially largely due to understaffing which whilst a reason- it's not an excuse. 

I'm from UK so don't have much knowledge of US social care, but over here we have a quality monitoring organisation called CQC (Care Quality Commission). These people go out into care homes, both announced and unannounced, and carry out checks on the home, giving them a rating for the public to view. If a home isn't complying with regulations (and this can include factors such as institutionalised care) CQC has the authority to enforce strict action plans, or even suspend the home. 

I would suggest contacting the equivalent of CQC where you live and tell them you are concerned that people living there are not receiving an acceptable standard of care. You can do this anonymously so no need to worry about your manager finding out it was you.

"Hey parlokin, I'm very sorry to hear about your father, but know you still have a lot of quality time left with him! Take everything you can so you have awesome memories with him.

FTD is being mentioned a lot, but the shaking symptom reminded me of my own father's diagnosis. He's presently suffering from Lewy Body dementia, which can manifest in Parkinson's-like symptoms. This all being said...

My best advice is to get him treatment early on and have the doctors narrow down his type of dementia. What works for one type of dementia can be so damaging to another. The sooner you start managing the disease, the higher the chance for a great quality of life!

As other people have said, he will need a caregiver. When is hard to tell. Usually, it's left up to family members such as children like us. Of course we want to do everything we can for our parents. It's hard to acknowledge when you might need help or to find a home to place him in. The thought of placing my father in a home horrified and sickened me at first, but as my father's dementia progressed, I became less and less qualified and emotionally able to take care of him. Know your limits, because after a while you might eventually be placing more strain on the pair of you than helping.

As far as remembering goes, in my experience, even if my dad didn't know my face that day, he knew he had a daughter. There's days where he doesn't recognize me at all, but the occasional ""Hey Boo!"" which was my childhood nickname, when I come to see him. I think, on some level, there's always some kind of cognition of surroundings and people, including loved ones and care givers.

Learn to be patient. Your father will go through a long period of being unable to convey what he means and it will frustrate him. Listen carefully, speak clearly. If he's having trouble with a word, let him think on a moment before offering help - sometimes helping them puts them off track and they forget what they're talking about altogether.

Dementia is a terrible, terrible disease, but it is not, by any means, a death sentence. Don't dwell on that. To mourn someone before they're gone is to all but give up on them. It is very difficult to deal with, but other caregivers and family members who have been through it before you will likely always be willing to help. Rely on that community. Rage if you need to, be upset if you need to. It gets easier for you as you learn to develop amazing coping skills. I often come away from visits at my father's home with hilarious stories.

They still have  personalities and are individuals! They're amazing people.

"I suggest you do a lit review of dysphagia in dementia.

I would also recommend that you ask the nursing home if they have a recreational therapist, and that you get in touch with him or her. They'll be able to help you find a more suitable time for you to read poetry to the patients. 

Here's a general overview. Please note that the following information is very general. If there are specific concerns, a full assessment by a speech-language pathologist and registered dietitian should be considered.

1. A lot of patients with dementia have a problem with swallowing, or [dysphagia](http://www.gnjournal.com/article/S0197-4572\(07\)00324-2/abstract), where food might go down the wrong pipe and cause them to choke or aspirate.
2. People with dementia have [impaired executive functioning](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13854040490507127#.Usyzl55dU9Y).
3. [Executive functioning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions) has a lot to do with eating, believe it or not. For example, simply putting together that you're thirsty means you should grab the cup of water and start drinking it might be a barrier. Or how do you grab the cup of water if you're restrained or arthritic or have vision problems...
4. Executive functioning also has to do with initiation, as well as attention/concentration.
5. This is partially why redirection works so well with dementia patients. (aka drawing their attention elsewhere). 

So. You have let's say, 20 dementia patients who are listening to you read poetry while they're eating. Now they have to divide their attention between the two tasks.

 Of those 20, let's say 10 have some form of dysphagia. Some are being fed. They're paying attention to you while somebody is shoving food in their mouths. They chew and chew and chew (because they get stuck on chewing and can have trouble initiating a swallow), and more food is being shoveled in, and they're listening to your poetry while they're chewing with 4 spoonfuls of food in their mouth. One of them chokes or aspirates because they weren't attending to the task of eating.

Then you have another patient who has very poor intake. It takes the nurses a lot of time redirecting the patient to the task of eating. Then she hears your poetry, and her attention is gone to listening, and away from eating. 

Then you have the patient who enjoys socialization during meal time, and actually eats more when he has the opportunity to engage in social discussion while having a meal. He eats more when you read your poetry.

The problem isn't that reading poetry during meal times is bad for ALL dementia patients: the problem is that dementia patients are so extremely varied in their behaviours that what is good for one may be very dangerous for another. If there is Recreational therapist in the facility, please find them and offer some volunteer time. They'd really appreciate it and i'm sure would put you to work.

"My father suffered from dementia before he died but he was in his mid-eighties when diagnosed. It's important to find out what sort of dementia, what is *causing* the dementia. The first thing the doctors did was a brain scan looking for damaged tissues that would be a sign of stroke. When they didn't find any structural damage, they assumed Alzheimer's was the culprit but after he died they realized his dementia had been caused by a leaky aortic valved which led to CHS congestive heart failure and told us that a persistent lack of oxygen to the brain had caused his dementia - a direct result of the untreated heart trouble.

For him, it progressed blindingly fast. Within a year of the first hint of trouble, he was no longer able to manage his life, pay bills, do any of the maintenance tasks required. 

You can never be too prepared. Get as much info as you can from his doctors and try to picture what to do when he can no longer be left safely alone anymore.

"My dad did a lot of weird stuff. It's been about three years since he was diagnosed, and boy has it been a rough ride.

He started by not knowing how to do things that he should've known how to do. He couldn't change the windshield wiper blades, he tried to paint the mailbox but got paint all over everything. 

Then he refused to sleep at night. He'd get up, and get fully dressed at three in the morning. I used to have to get up with him to watch him. I'd tell him, ""Dad, it's three in the morning. Everyone is sleeping."" ""Well, I'm unusual,"" he'd say. 

And then his behavior started getting violent, and he'd never been a violent person. My mom dropped a pill on the floor and when she bent down to pick it up, he punched her in the back of the head. He still gets ""agitated"" to this day, although now he's basically bedridden so it's easier to handle. 

I have a million stories. He peed in his toothbrush cup in the bathroom because he thought it was a urinal. He pooped in the middle of the park because he couldn't communicate to my mom that he needed the bathroom. He tried to attack me with a book. He pinned my mom against a wall. He chased a caregiver around the house, telling her to get out. He threw food on the floor at a nice restaurant. He tried to kick my dog.

It's been a wild ride.

Edit: Some things that helped us.
1. Keep pool noodles around the house. That way when they get agitated and want to hit things, hand them a pool noodle. My dad was too far gone to realize that a pool noodle can't do any damage.
2. Now that my dad is bedridden, instead of a pool noodle, we hand him stuffed animals. He tries to rip them apart, and sometimes he hits us with them while we change his diaper. But they're soft and washable.
3. Take away his keys. No more driving for those who have violent outbursts. Letting them drive only enables them to harm others. It's a pain because then you have to drive them everywhere, but it's better than a lawsuit.

As mentioned by another commenter, knowing what kind of dementia is pretty important, so my next thoughts revolve around how to find out.

My mom had alzheimer's.  She was also proud, not at all inclined to acknowledge what was happening.

There were 2 or 3 other family members besides myself who were involved, we all played a part in eventually getting her situation in hand.

Do you have other family members, or friends who can strategize with you?  Also, one or another of those people may be more adept at talking to your dad in a way that goes a little better at letting him drop his defenses, even if only a little bit.

You ask if there are different types - [Here's a graphic](http://www.thehealthsteer.com/dementia-global-pandemic-infographic/) that includes a brief description of the main types.  What comes next as to progression, what will be forgotten, etc., is highly dependent on the type of dementia he has.

If you can get him to sign a release with the Drs allowing them to discuss his diagnosis with you or some other family member, that would be ideal.

Hope some of this helps, reply any time if you get more information or have more questions - Good luck!",false,true,t1_cfag9er,calicoan,,0,1391896633,t5_2rfqf,t3_1xdrz6,t3_1xdrz6,2,1432312946,0,0,cfag9er,dementia,2,,,
"Hey there.

I'm really sorry to hear about your mother.

I understand the plight of needing money to sustain you, but early treatment is key to a longer, healthier life with slower development of dementia. Your mother also needs to factor in things like how her driving or decision making skills might affect others. I entirely understand the need to feel normal and healthy, but if your mother continues ignoring the signs and refuse to seek medical help, not only is she sabotaging her own outcome with dementia, but she's putting other people at risk too.

It's very hard, I know, but what's harder is being in the car with a parent who forgets how to drive on a highway. It's really difficult to feel like you've done everything you could when early detection is key and you didn't insist she go to the doc. I know, because these are things we did with my dad.

I know it's a difficult situation and I'm sorry that yet another family has to go through this, but you will figure it out. The dementia community is strong and supportive. ",false,true,t1_cjzvql2,Euryno,,0,1408967892,t5_2rfqf,t3_2ein8u,t3_2ein8u,1,1427369020,0,0,cjzvql2,dementia,1,,,

"I have a suspicious that some dementiated patients respond much more readily towards fresh and unexpected stimulus compared to the mundane mediocrities of life. If I remember correctly, unexpected things are handled by a different area of the brain, thus it could be that dementia has a smaller impact on this area compared to remembering things that happen frequently.

Just a hypothesis, but seems to correlate with my grandmother's behavior; she'll forget I'm present within 10min, but still remembers when a family friend would make an unexpected visit.

"I had a relative with dementia and saw their decline over the last decade of their live as well as what dementia looked like in others living in the assisted living facility for the last several years.  Inevitably people important to the residents would pass away.  Most residents would have no recollection of the deaths to only a vague remembrance.

One of the only blessings of the disease was that my relative first became fuzzy on the details of the earlier deaths of their spouse and child and then seemed to forget completely.  

Like others have suggested, I advocate redirecting.  Your grandmother lacks the capacity to remember and understand.  Telling her the truth over and over when she can't remember is just confusing her.  

For positive experiences like a wedding she attends or the birth of a great-grandchild a scrapbook isn't a horrible idea.  But there's no reason to try and have your grandma remember the negative things in life anymore.

"I think it might have something more to do with culture and liability rather than money. I don't doubt for some homes money doesn't play an issue but the home I work at is really awesome in regards to resident quality of life and I could see them doing something like this, if not for the fact that so many people are sue happy anymore. If a resident would go out to the bus stop and slip on something (ice, branch, uneven sidewalk, rock, etc.) then the family can sue for a lot of money, or in the case of the baker, the gentleman could burn himself. Sure he's done it millions of times during his career but now the family sees him as a fragile elder that needs protection from such things. The little village, though, sounds more like a money issue. I've read about it before but I can't really see any insurance company covering for it (would be very expensive) when the resident could go into a traditional home. The main factor might be more culture, though. We're usually slow (in my opinion) to adopt new ideas in regards to Europe so people here (US) might just be happy to go with the same old, same old way of doing things. Though I have noticed many changes coming down the road just from the two years I have worked as an Activities Aide. Many nursing homes around in my area are trying to do away with alarmed seat belts, including the one I work in, in favor of pad alarms so our residents don't feel so much as being restrained. Though for the residents who must have an alarmed seat belt, I always tell them it's like a seat belt in a car, for their protection.



TL;DR: I think it's more of a cultural issue than a money issue, but I don't doubt that some nursing homes do care more about the money than residents themselves.",false,true,t1_cgl9qa8,wolffan98,,0,1396763919,t5_2rfqf,t3_229wkw,t1_cgkup54,3,1433230337,0,0,cgl9qa8,dementia,3,,,
"Although something she can hold/pet and will give sensory stimulation is a good idea, I'd recommend a collage of old family photos, if she doesn't already have such a thing. As dementia progresses, the more recent memories go away, but the memories from their younger years remain intact longer. Looking at photos of the family closer to the way she sees them now may help her reminisce and feel happy to see the family she knows, so to speak.

"Hey Euryno. First off, I'm sorry about your father too, but I think you're doing a great service by responding on here.. You didn't have to, it means a lot to hear from people who are going through the same. To be honest, I've been kind of avoiding responding to you! I have been having this feeling that if I ignore it it'll go away. Clearly incorrect on all levels. ..

I talked to him this morning again about this, and he said my uncle and grandmother had it and lived to be quite aware for a while. However he is still being very coy about the exact diagnosis so I am going to  have to accompany him to the doctor, it's as simple as that. He's probably not even fully informed of the diagnosis. 

&gt;Don't dwell on that. To mourn someone before they're gone is to all but give up on them.

This was eye-opening. Thank you. I will remember that the next time I am feeling suffocated from the stress of this.

I love your story of getting the best from the visits. I am going to confront this soon, and your advice is really helpful. 

Probably the worst part about this is not knowing how it will manifest. Like yesterday, our company (not sure if you read, but we own a company together) bid a 1.5million dollar contract for construction of apartments. Now the way this works is we bid, we might get the job or not, but if we do... it is often months if not years away. SO we are forecasting our livelihoods all the time. It's hard to tell if he will be around for that job, do you know what I mean? Will he be able to recall the ins and outs of these projects? I seriously doubt it, which is putting a lot of stress on me, and I'm not sure how to talk to him about it. I need to basically HIRE someone to replace him while he's still here. It's kind of messed up but I don't know how else it'll work properly.

Anyway that's kind of an esoteric version of how this is affecting us. I'm sorry I started rambling. It feels incredibly therapuetic to just talk it out. Thank you again Euryno. I have this thread saved of course and I will remember you when crises occur - and if you need to talk, you know you can message me anytime. I'm a nice guy, quite shy in real life, but I enjoy meeting and talking to people online. So if you need anyhting just let me know. Thank you again.

"I actually created this account to reply to you as I usually use reddit for work (and I don't usually post!). My dad, 61, has FTP and is (i think) just starting stage 7. He's had it for 10+ yrs but was only diagnosed ~5 yrs ago. 
Everyone has given you very valuable advice and I would do just as they say: make communication more visual and work with things that are familiar to him (old tv shows, music, etc). Every FTP patient is different so what I have to say may not apply to you and I think my dad has much more advanced FTP, but here's a couple of things that I wish someone had told my mother and I when dad was first diagnosed:

1.  **Keep him physically active.** His immune system will thank you. Remember it's only his mind that's sick, his body still needs nourishing. My dad actually got pneumonia from a weakened immune system, he used to stay in bed all day. In later stages your dad will have difficulty walking or going up steps, so keeping him active now will help you a lot after.

2.  **The patient is always right.** My dad developed very strong fixations (to hair, to paper, to food) and would physically push you out of the way to get to those objects. I found there's no point in fighting him if things can get physical and thus dangerous to him or you, sometimes you gotta let him have that piece of paper/fork/plastic bag and retrieve it after he forgets about it. Frustration that turns into anger towards him will not solve things. Remember he's sick, he doesn't know what he's doing.

3.  **Keep a routine.** Dad's appetite is huge and I read it's part of the disease. A routine helps him 'understand' he eats at 8, 12 and 5 with snacks at 7. He'll want to eat at those times even if he's not hungry just because it's his routine. Same with walks and showers.

4.  **Love your dad.** He might not be able to show much affection later on, but he can still receive it. He smiles when I walk in and sometimes might even call me by name. I cherish those moments and make sure he knows how much he is loved. He knows he is safe with us.

5.  **Plan for long term.** We had to move dad to a long term care home because he eventually needed 24/7 supervision. FTP usually affects younger people so most places aren't equipped/trained to deal w/FTP. We've had to fight nurses and doctors who wanted to keep dad sedated to make their jobs easier. I don't blame them though, 5-6 staff members for 30+ dementia and alzheimer's residents and dad being 1.80m and 92km didn't make their jobs a walk in a park. Disclaimer: I'm not saying we are against medication (dad takes various pills) but we don't want to restrict what little personality my dad has left if his symptoms can be managed with a non-drug approach.

6.  **Take care of yourself and your aunt.** Care giving can be physically and mentally draining. Take time off to do your own things and don't feel guilty about doing them. I keep telling myself ""I'm sure dad would want me to have a life too"".  

There is SO much more I could say about FTD but I think I already wrote too much! PM if you want to talk.

TL;DR: Keep his body healthy, be patient, love your dad, take care of yourself :)

"Well, it's not a bad thing, until it is.  I saw a relative decline over about a decade, the better part of that in an assisted living facility, from what was most likely vascular dementia.  

Getting out of the house had to be modified pretty quickly.  That turned into getting out of the house/facility for a couple hours instead of a whole day.  Then it turned into going only to very familiar places with familiar people.  There was little to no going out in the last two years.   

Activities had to be adjusted: going to the in-home chapel vs. the offsite church.  Doing complex crafts turned to simple crafts, turned to playing with a ball.  Doctor's visits in offices became house calls.

I would try to remove one of the marked fuses.
Drive to a remote area (big parking lot), start the engine and remove one fuse (fuse 22 or 26) at a time. If the engine dies, that's the fuse to remove.
Another way is to shut down the engine, remove fuse 21 or 25 and try to start the engine. As long the fuse diagram is somewhat logical, the engine should not start with any of these fuses removed.

"Thank you for responding! No worries about it being late. I know that taking and scoring my own online test may not be the best idea, but I'm just trying to see if there is anything noticeably wrong in my answers. For the most part it's not affecting my every day life, but I am so cognitively sluggish I don't do as much as I normally do. I used to love driving and had no problems taking long trips, but now I feel uneasy driving anywhere, especially at night. It feels like my processing of information is delayed. I often just feel very out of it and slow. I can't speak on how a 80 year old person processes things, but I sometimes feel like my brain is processing at the rate of an old person. 

As far as my memory, I have trouble recalling things I did just last night. Or even just today.  Medications I've taken and conversations I've had. Usually I can recall it if someone brings up part of the convo or says something that makes me trigger the memory, but none of my memories come naturally anymore. It's almost as if I need to be reminded of something to trigger my memories. 

I did not have any noticeable signs of a stroke but I am concerned about something like a silent stroke, where the symptoms wouldn't be that noticeable. My concern for that is because I was diagnosed with pvc's back in September of last year. They told me they're benign but they happen so frequently (10+ a minute) I'm worried that it may have been misdiagnosed. Also, just yesterday I got results back from a heart MRI I had performed a few days ago and it revealed my heart is only pumping at 51%. The cardiologist said it should pump anywhere between 54-75%.

"In two years since official diagnosis of dementia for my father.   They say that once diagnosed you can look back over the previous 5 years and take account of some the strange things that the patient may have done ... and blame the dementia for it.  My dad would come back from work, close the garage door and not come in for 15 minutes.  Turns out he was touching up the car from parking lot scratches (he was the cause of, I can safely guess).   He worked with colors/art in his job... he had to do more and more re-do's to correct the mistakes.  In retrospect, through all his complaining those years I consider his boss to be a very patient person.  Two years and such decline.  Now he sees aliens, cannot identify himself in pictures, reaches out to shake his own hand in the mirror ... and asked me the other day to kill him as he cannot take it anymore.

The cruel trick is that there are moments when, although far from who he was, his old personality, humor, references, acknowledgements come forth.  My mother and I look at each other and think maybe he has returned, maybe we should hold off on placing him assisted living.  But the moment passes, he punches the walls, his legs, curses, is given some seraquel and fades off to sleep.  He gets admitted this Thursday.  We have feelings of relief and guilt and loss and resignation.  I see my mother crying, entering a new foreign stage of life without her husband to wake up to.  My father will probably never see the house, the backyard,  some of his pets ever again.  It makes me break down sometimes to see that this man who I idolized come to this sad fate.

My posted question concerned Mom's diagnosis (or lack thereof) and whether getting a more exact diagnosis would be worth putting her through more testing, but I take your point very well that it may be worth getting a more definitive diagnosis for my own sake, and for that of my siblings, knowing that Gram went down the same road.

I am as blatant as I can be whenever I talk to my many siblings about Mom (and Gram) that they should be preparing themselves for the same walk -- Long-term care insurance, I advise. On the other hand, I am as convinced as the rest of my sibs are that we will probably(!) age and die more like my Dad did -- wits completely about him until he passed away at 92. So we hope . . .

"Oh, it's fine, I'm fine - shit happens. What I've said to people is that, if you're lucky, you bury your parents. If you're unlucky, and they are REALLY unlucky, they bury you. I'd far rather go through this ""usual"" pain of losing them than have them go through the anguish of my untimely death. It's how it's supposed to be. 

I know I'm high-reactive and prone to anxiety, so I can control for things (not act out, or put other people on the spot) - and I'm OK with letting myself cry whenever and wherever I need to, pretty much, which is huge in terms of coping with stress. 

I was on benzodiazepines on and off for 20 years. I managed to get off them totally in January 2012, haven't had any in my body since. I was pretty happy about that. They are really great for short-term anxiety management but long-term they just fuck up your GABA system. I find that my mood swings are much less severe now I'm not constantly pushing my system around with prescription drugs. 

To be honest, turning 40 probably helped too. Hormones are a fucking bitch and a half when you're young. 

Biggest things have been eating greens, taking vitamin D3 drops (I was deficient), and moderate exercise. Yoga is great. Walking is great. Gotta get out of the house. My doctor gave me a prescription for ""NO"" - meaning, to tell more people ""no"" - that was awesome. I was letting other people's expectations string me out all the time. Saying ""no"" is an important skill to learn. 

Time management, body management, and knowing my limitations. I developed compassion for myself. I also learned how not to ""close the loop"" with anxiety - just to let it ebb and flow how it wants to, instead of feeling bad about it and constantly trying to control it. I don't know if that sounds weird...it's like not being anxious *about* being anxious was a really big thing.

I read an article the other day that living with someone with Alzheimer's is alot like doing improv 24/7. 

Something that has really helped me is the book The 36 Hour Day. My aunt's husband had dementia and she reccommended it to me. Also alz.org has links to support groups around your area. Also, if you need anything, feel free to shoot me a PM. I understand how it feels being so young and dealing with such a heavy responsibility.

"1) Don't beat yourself up. This disease sucks.

2) don't force your kids to visit your grandmother. They should remember her as she was, not at she is now. 

3) DO take time for yourself. Go away for a weekend. No kids, no parents, no work, no phone. Get a pedi, facial, massage. Pamper yourself and reset and recharge.  

This is how I deal with this disease...... My loving, caring, wonderful, kind, polite, best mom in the world is gone. The woman I deal with now is mean and spiteful and is not my mom. Lots of times I have to call her by her first name because she thinks she has two kids, not three, and when I call her mom it upsets her. I've managed to emotionally separate the two women (if that makes sense).  It makes it easier for me to deal with her and take care of her. I'm able to make decisions about her care easier when I remove the emotion. For example, she needs a tooth fixed. Dentist wants to crown it.  I told them to pull it.  There is no way my mom could handle the procedure/process of getting a crown.  Do I want to see my mother with a missing tooth? No. Is this the right thing to do for the woman whose care I've been trusted with? Yes, without a doubt.

I doubt that makes sense, and makes me sound like a cold hearted bitch, but it's what works for me.

"you ABSOLUTELY need to go immediately to a lawyer and get an all encompassing durable power of attorney granting you the ability to deal with your dads property and financial affairs.   particularly since you own a business together.  do this literally first thing, and try your hardest for it to be as broad as possible (changing beneficiaries on investment accounts, real property transactions, etc).   a good personal lawyer should have a template and it wont cost you more than a few hundred bucks.

one of the biggest issues with dementia is ""agnosia"" when a person loses the ability to tell that they have an issue with memory or decisionmaking.  often the dementia attacks the executive function areas of the brain first, which leads to irrational/destructive/nonsensical decisonmaking.  this could be disastrous when it comes to financials.   

example:  in a year he makes another bad purchase decision and when you confront him about it he denies it.    or he decides to donate his part of the company to a casino or charity or cult.   gambling could easily become an issue. you need to start thinking about how you protect him from himself as his cognition deteriorates.  this will involve you becoming increasingly involved in his personal finances as a monitor and counsellor.  try doing this sooner rather than later. there may come a point where he literally doesnt understand the impact of his decisions, or what good decisions are.  his personality could also change - sometimes conservative frugal people become wildly spendthrift, or just start making bad, inexplicable decisions.

"Hey, you're not coping so badly with this as you think, lots of people just shut down completely, don't even try to figure out anything to actually *do*.

I'm a mom, my kid is 24 - As a mom, I'd say your mom would love it if you stay in touch as much as you can, and she probably wouldn't want you to leave school, she'd want to see you getting ahead in your life as much as possible while she's still able.

Skype, smartphone texts &amp; pics, phone calls, emails - There are lots of ways to let her know you're thinking of her, to include her in your life.  Ask her how she's feeling, tell her you're scared and you know she must be scared too, you can comfort each other.  Ask her everything you can think of about her life before you were born, so you'll know.

The hardest step may be the first - Kind of sounds like there hasn't been much talking about it, just plain talk, if so just opening the subject could be super challenging.  

But take my advice, if it fits - 

Don't ""wait for the right moment"", 

Don't hold back because ""I haven't figured out the right words"" - 

Any words are the right words, every moment is the right moment - It may start out all awkward, but that part is over with in a flash, merely an instant of discomfort, with a huge payoff in all the good that you'll have with her.

The feelings of sluggishness/poor memory you're having are worth some discussion with your doctor, even outside of their possible relationship to your other health concerns.

The test would probably just be a serious of questions similar to the SAGE test - not anything invasive.

You're right that she needs help, but I presume she is legally competent?  My advice would be to have the family talk to a lawyer who specializes in elder care.

It sounds like you need to get her out of your bf's brothers place.  Can you convince him to kick her out?  It's in his interest too.

Take pictures of the cut on her face.  If need be, call an ambulance if the wound worsens or if she becomes unmanageable.  That will force the issue and will result in a report (if she manages to decline a trip to the hospital). The legal situation will be helped if there is a diagnosis from a qualified professional.

"This diseases varies so much person to person that it's hard to give any blanket type of advice. My dad has more of the behavioral variant of the disease, which doesn't sound to be exactly what your dad has but there are definitely some similarities. I'm not sure that everything I'm touching on below will apply to your situation, but just take from it what you need!

Instead of saying sexually inappropriate things, my dad generally doesn't talk anymore. His only reaction to anything is laughter, whether it be appropriate or not.  I'll tell him that I love him and he'll just laugh. The inappropriate stuff your dad is saying probably won't get any better, so try to learn to not take anything personally that he says. Don't call him out and embarrass him either, he doesn't realize he's doing it, just take it in stride if you can.  

Also, with regards to to your dad's hygiene, you need to stay on top of that. He might say he washed his hair but didn't, he might say he put on clean clothes but they're the same clothes he's been wearing for days. Lay out new clothes for him to wear after showering, and try to get the old in the hamper quickly if you can. 

I found that in communicating with my dad, it was easier for him to understand if you had a visual of what your asking. Just casually hold up the ketchup and mustard in your hands when your asking him what he wants, he can point to what he needs instead of trying to come up with the words on his own. 

Lastly, familiarity is your friend! Anything that he used to love doing that you can still get him to do, do it. Get his favorite tv shows on DVD and have them readily available. If is favorite pastime was fishing and he's still capable of going and sitting in a boat, take him. Buy his favorite board game, or give him little projects to work on if he liked doing stuff with his hands. His attention span will likely decline in the coming years, so anything you can do to spend quality time with him, go for it! Creature comforts and familiar faces are key.

When she was first diagnosed with it, I didn't know how to react and I avoided her. I'm not even sure why. Being with her made me uncomfortable and I had no idea what to do or say but that's a lame excuse at best.

"first- i am not a lawyer- the loan has little to do with owns the house, it belongs to the persons the house is titled to. Your home is usually protected from creditors in the event the homeowner dies- other than the mortgage. I'm not in Maryland- state laws vary. In other words, when you die, the credit card company has no legal right to demand your heirs sell your home so they can be paid. 

A nursing home Alzheimer situation runs about $5000 a month more or less. Other options are hiring help at home. 

You should be aware that if you move cash into other peoples accounts, the government can look back three years at records and find out. 

I would talk to a case manager and find out what options are available, sometimes there are day care programs, respite weeks to give the family some needed time off. Find out if he was a veteran- they may offer help also.

Other other thing to remember, men usually do NOT live long with this condition. Usually just a couple years when they develop symptoms late in life. Your GF is already quite old. He may only go on for another year.

You should look to see if he has a WILL- often an attorney will set up other needed documents such as power of attorney- which would allow someone else make financial decisions in the event the person is incapable.

"Thank you for that thorough reply. I am still trying to internalize everything, and obviously he's gonna need time too. Can't imagine what he is thinking. Which means I need to fill my head with research, rather than anxiety, in the meantime. Thanks for the links too.

I am not sure who he put on file at the VA, but myself or his mother would be the closest relative. (He is single. And it just hit me... it's crazy to think my grandmother is going to be in comparatively better health.) He got the diagnosis on a routine check-up at the VA, which is to maintain enrollment in the program. I'm sure we will transfer the diagnosis to a hospital to get in with a specialist. But if I am understanding correctly they aren't going to talk to me at all until I am allowed in his writing. Shouldn't be a problem, hopefully.

The business is going to be a can of worms. And sorry, when I say multimillion dollar business, I am talking about revenues; we're not filthy rich people. (It's a contracting business: hotels, schools, etc.) However it affords us a decent living and we employ plenty of good people... so I have to figure out how to make this work without him. He has been taking a more relaxed role in recent years, but he is definitely the backbone at the end of the day. Which is even more stress. I'm the only other officer/only one with ant stock, so it should be pretty cut and dried. But things like licenses, removal/replacement of registered titles if he needs to retire, will require a lawyer. And it's possible the family will be surrounding everything if he is gone.

That said, this sort of transition was coming anyway. In a different way.. He's been talking about retiring or being paid for part-time consulting. (Consulting!)

I understand I may be overreacting to the smoking thing, but he smokes so much I can see how that may be making it worse. But best to see what the doctors say, as you suggest.

"&gt; If I can make one suggestion, it would be keep doing what you're doing. Be there for your mom and help with all that you can. Even if it is just hanging out for a minute so she can go to the store,or get away for bit. Everything you do helps a lot even though it doesn't seem like it does.

This.

There is little enough you can do for your father. His condition will only go one way—downhill. Enjoy him in his more lucid moments. Does he know he is getting more and more forgetful? I went through it more than 30 years ago with my mother (who had gone through it with *her* mother, but back then the doctors just called it hardening of the arteries, and also back then there were no medications for lowering cholesterol, hypertension or blood sugar, so the afflicted often died from something else long before they would have done from the ravages of Alzheimer disease), and one day I got brave enough to ask her if she was aware that she was becoming more and more forgetful. Of course she was, and she broke down and cried, saying she knew she was getting just like her mother had been. Maybe it would help both of you if you could discuss his condition with him, let him say how he feels about it. Forgive me if you've already done this—it's just that some folks think the ""it"" should never be spoken about with the patient.

&gt;I don't think the meds are working.

People have individual reactions to medication. Since there's no cure yet, all the dementia meds can do is postpone the inevitable, and other meds can work on depression, anxiety, etc. Find out the names of his meds and look them up online so you know what you can expect from what he's been given.

&gt;What do you do for your family member to make them happy?

Talk about the past, which is what they remember best. Ask him about when he was a child, his relatives, when he was in the Army. Show him old photographs, give him hugs just for the sake of the hug, tell him you love him just the way he is.

&gt;I know that my father is still here with me, but he sort of isn't.

Try to respond to the parts that still are.

Enlist the help of other family members, neighbors. If your mom isn't inclined to go to neighbors, perhaps you could ask them if when they're heading to the store could they ask your mom if there is anything she needs, or if they wouldn't mind sitting with your dad while she goes out. Your mother, the primary caregiver, is the one for whom you really need to watch out.

Have you checked with the [Alzheimer Foundation](http://www.afamembers.org/search-basic.php) and the [Alzheimer Association](http://www.alz.org/apps/findus.asp) to see if there are chapters in your area which have meetings with other family members or at least some services which might be of help to you and your parents? Also try [here](http://www.city-data.com/forum/) to find an area near you to ask if anyone knows of such support groups locally.

&gt;They end up fighting a lot because he gets very mean sometimes.

I don't doubt it. But fighting with a dementia patient rarely produces a win. Gotta work real hard to find a way to deal w/o fighting. Those organizations can give you some ideas to work with. If they don't have chapters in your area, [look for online forums](https://www.alzconnected.org) where you can communicate regularly with other family members of dementia patients. 

&gt;I just want to hear that I'm not alone. 

You most certainly are not, even if it feels that way sometimes. The dementia problem in the first world today is huge and only getting bigger.

Good luck.

But keeping in touch is very difficult, my mom is at the stage where she cannot learn to text, definitely not Skype, and now even phoning is becoming a challenge for her. She will often phone me and mean to phone someone completely different.

Anyways, I really gotta sit down and talk to her, try to remind myself what it was like before she got worse.

"Since you have done the paper work, I would be calling. Call in and ask the doctor's nurse what your next steps should be. She will likely have to call you back after having that conversation with the doctor. Ask specific questions like the ones in the next paragraph. Also, make sure that they are not contacting her and that they are contacting you. Or at LEAST contacting her *as well as* contacting you, every time. Explain your concerns about her not being able to make those kind of decisions.

Have you not attended the appointments with your mother to be able to ask questions? You may need to be a bit forceful (but not rude). Come with questions prepared like, ""What is the next step?"" ""When do I make the next appointment for?"" Etc. Don't let them take the lead on that. I would have thought you would maybe have a referral to a neurologist by now.

What I would do right now, is write up a letter/statement about your mother's health. Include everything that you included here. Send the letter to her physician and make sure to include all of your mom's identifying information in it. Mention her falls, her recent brushes with disaster, the signs you see, her mother's diagnosis, everything. If they do the right thing, they should put this information on file. Keep a copy for yourself to use as talking points with the physician. Maybe write and send this letter, give it 2 days, then call. Mention the letter when you call. It is often easier to have these conversations without your mother around (as I find it to be), since she will likely deny or play down a lot of the events. This way you can have a candid discussion about her.

As for your last paragraph, don't worry about that. There will be plenty of time to dwell on it when those come around. Focus on the doctor and getting her help. Once it has progressed further, you can start to worry about how it will affect the rest of your life. The only thing I would try and accept now is that yes, caring for your mother might be your life. Unfortunately, you may be in the unlucky lottery that is children who have to take care of their parents in a more direct way. It isn't a great place to be and no one wants to be here, but we accept it and try to make the best of both our lives. It isn't fun, but it isn't a death sentence.

"I haven't been on this subreddit in a month or two so I'm playing catch up. Sorry to respond so late but I know you are still going through this issue. 

Firstly, I'm sorry this is happening to your family. My father suffers from FTD as well and it has changed my life drastically since his diagnosis. It is a hopeless disease and no one can predict what symptoms/complications will develop next. 

My mom was in the same position as your father. Although this disease is hard on you, make sure you are there for your father as much as you can be. Caregiving brings so many emotions and is draining both mentally and physically. If you can take care of your mom from time to time or even just hang out with your dad while he takes care of her, do it. 

Start looking into a care facility for your mom. This disease can take sudden turns that will require more than your dad can handle. With long waiting lists and finding ways to pay for the facility, it is never too soon to start searching for a home for your mom. 

As for you, alz.org has a 24/7 number that can give resources, info and counseling whenever you need it. I ended up calling them for the first time at 3am last week. They were supposed to give me info on a site that aimed at FTD but we got sidetracked. Try calling sometime. 1-800-272-3900. 

One thing I can say that is positive about FTD vs. Alzheimer's  is that my dad still knows who I am. He has difficulty finding words and cannot hold a conversation but he still says my name, asks for hugs, and tells me he loves me. I look around his nursing home and realize I'm a lucky duck to have that. PM if you need anything. You are not alone in this.

"I first noticed something was off, when he was 13 and finishing up the 8th grade. One of his teachers handed out some tests, but he didn't receive one. He didn't know how to handle the situation and so he didn't say anything and missed the test.

Throughout the summer he have temper tantrums, often times breaking things. He broke his own glasses on one occasion. Many times he was incomprehensible. He would often say ""My brain is trying to kill me"" but he couldn't explain what he meant by that.
The following fall, he started 9th grade in a new school. But he would often go home due to emotional issues. He eventually had to be home schooled. It was around then he was diagnosed with PSTD and Schizophrenia.
I think it was winter of his 9th grade that I realized how far his comprehension skills had fallen. I remember I tried to teach him a simple exercise. Perhaps a leg lift. A 6 year old would have been able to copy what I was doing, but he wasn't. Some how he could not decipher the details of the movements I was doing.

I remember in the spring, we set up a playdate with his old best friend, but when he came over, he had little emotional reaction to him. His best friend, who he used to spend countless fun hours with. And we could barely get them to interact. He asked them one question, 'what religion are you'.

The majority of the mental degradation happened within these 2-2.5 years. He eventually got over his anger/emotional issues. He's pretty happy most days. But his intelligence hasn't returned, and seems to have declined over the next 5-8 years.

I think it was 5 years later that he lost the ability to use the bathroom by himself. I think it was 7-8 years later he answers most of the questions asked of him with the phrase 'nothing no'.

"Hey there!

I'm very sorry about your grandmother. 

If religion is a point of contention with your family, it's best not to discuss it. Your father is in the process of losing a parent, which isn't easy at any age. If the thought of an afterlife helps him come to terms with everything that's going on, that's okay. Just because you support him in this doesn't mean you're lessening your values - it's exactly as it sounds: you're supporting your family member in a way that helps them.

This isn't to say your beliefs aren't important! I'm a crazy mish mash of Buddhist and pagan (I don't even know, lol), but my mother is just Christian and it helps her to think there's an afterlife when it comes to my father. Just nod and smile, appreciate it for what it is - someone using religion to find a way to deal with things.

"In two years since official diagnosis of dementia for my father.   They say that once diagnosed you can look back over the previous 5 years and take account of some the strange things that the patient may have done ... and blame the dementia for it.  My dad would come back from work, close the garage door and not come in for 15 minutes.  Turns out he was touching up the car from parking lot scratches (he was the cause of, I can safely guess).   He worked with colors/art in his job... he had to do more and more re-do's to correct the mistakes.  In retrospect, through all his complaining those years I consider his boss to be a very patient person.  Two years and such decline.  Now he sees aliens, cannot identify himself in pictures, reaches out to shake his own hand in the mirror ... and asked me the other day to kill him as he cannot take it anymore.  It is the saddest, most terrifying transformation I have seen and because it is somebody I love it is even more painful.  I have been supporting my mother as a caretaker but suggesting for a long time to get an in-house aid.  She agreed to it last month but she feels her home is uncomfortable by the new person.  My father gets agitated when the caretaker comes in.  Hygiene is gone.  The cruel trick is that there are moments when, although far from who he was, his old personality, humor, references, acknowledgements come forth.  My mother and I look at each other and think maybe he has returned, maybe we should hold off on placing him assisted living.  But the moment passes, he punches the walls, his legs, curses, is given some seraquel and fades off to sleep.  He gets admitted this Thursday.  We have feelings of relief and guilt and loss and resignation.  I see my mother crying, entering a new foreign stage of life without her husband to wake up to.  My father will probably never see the house, the backyard,  some of his pets ever again.  It makes me break down sometimes to see that this man who I idolized come to this sad fate.

"I have not read anything that indicates the disease progress will significantly accelerate specifically because of stress like this, but the way your grandmother may deal with it can certainly make her symptoms worse. Stress of any kind is harder to deal with when you're less able to reason through it and plan ahead. It's not uncommon for someone with dementia who is faced with the death of someone close to them to not be able to figure out how to keep moving on. You've said your grandmother already appears depressed - pay attention to this, and be sure her doctor knows. North America is way too quick to move to antipsychotics to treat this but antidepressants might be useful, and sleep aides could help if she has increased sleep disturbances related to the stress, depression and dementia. I'm NOT a doctor and I'm NOT giving you medical advice (ie talk to a real life doctor instead of just taking my anonymous word for it) but there are a lot of studies that support use of melatonin (generally 1-3mg, never more than 3mg, check with the pharmacist first!) as a sleep aide - a good sleep will help your grandmother deal with everything better, and melatonin does not increase fall risk.

I also have to warn you about something - when you no longer are able to think abstractly long into the future, it's not uncommon to feel that suicide is the logical option. Listen to your grandmother, and don't be surprised or hurt if she mentions this, but do make sure she sees her doctor for help. It's hard to figure out the future if your brain doesn't work, and it can seem logical. She likely won't actually do anything more than say it seems like what she should do, but don't let it surprise you too much if it happens. It's good she's got caring family around her, but that is a tough thing to hear, if it happens, especially if you're also dealing with your uncle.

"I work as a live-in caregiver to a dementia patient going on 19 months now.  I know exactly, what you are going through.  My patient is very combative; she has clawed me several times, kicked me, punched me and spit on me, oh and pulled my hair out.  She's a bitch.  It's hard to live like this and after the winter season I'll be throwing in the towel.  It takes a very emotionally strong person to do what we do; that's not to say we are weak minded people but *tell a person they're crazy enough times, they'll start to believe it.*

When my patient gets ugly with me I just start laughing at her and soon enough shell start.  Its annoying and sometimes I angry-laugh, having to force it out, but it works.  When she is combative, I walk away.  I give her 5-10 minutes to cool down and I try again.  During showers it's harder to walk away and I usually have help from my boyfriend (its his grandmother); he will hold her hands so she isn't hitting either of us or grabbing the showerhead.  

I've become less of a chill person, internally.  I'm now very anxious and get annoyed by almost anyone.  I really want to just go somewhere I can be alone.  I've cried myself to sleep plenty of nights and it's hard for me to find motivation to wake up.

My advice to you is to look at your patient in a SciFi way - they're a zombie. They have no sane mind and wouldn't be alive if we weren't there to feed them and make sure nothing conflicted their safety.  So to say, the person you are caring for is just a shell now, of someone who once was.  The person they used to be is no longer existent and is continuing to diminish.  It may sound harsh but compare who that person once was to who they are now.  Until you figure out if you should continue, remember to breathe.  Walk away for 5 minutes and laugh at them; that's how I've learned to deal.",false,false,t1_cmz2ujo,cosmicberryfairypie,,0,1418946659,t5_2rfqf,t3_2ppjq1,t3_2ppjq1,2,1425327285,0,0,cmz2ujo,dementia,2,,,

"Hi, I just stumbled upon this. Your story sounds exactly like my wife's (we're in our mid-20's btw). Her grandmother showed signs at the same age as your Grandmother's. About 4 years ago, her Mom started showing signs. They did many tests, thinking it was everything but Early-Onset Alzheimer's but after some scans they found that it was. To say she's gone downhill for the past while would be a huge understatement. She's in her final stages and won't be around much longer. It's been very tough to see her memories fade, and I can only imagine the confusion and pain you and your family are going through right now.

It will be different for everyone, but we have decided against getting tested for now. We're young, and we still have our lives ahead of us. We want a family in the future too. I think your concern about becoming a burden to your future children and husband is completely understandable.

That being said, there's plenty of things you can do now to lower your risk of Alzheimer's. Apart from the healthy living recommendations, which we should all be doing anyway (diet, exercise, keeping your brain active), there's some strong evidence that active components of marijuana (yes, the illegal drug) can have a very strong impact of slowing Alzheimer's progression or preventing it. If you have any reservations about marijuana, just read these articles and studies:

"Thank you. This is the sort of anecdote I am looking for. I also want to look into the science side of the question.

Most care guides say that there should be no distractions during mealtime, yet at the same time suggest that the caregiver encourage them.

I suspect that these caregiver guides are not research based, and may be wrong. Now a television playing in the background might be a distraction, but I hypothesize that personal interaction may be stimulating some of the sub cortical brain structures that are involved in eating.

"I don't have family with the disease, but I work on an Alzheimer's ward. The truth, for most cases, is that if the person is self-aware (as in they see the changes happening), this is the hardest time of the disease for most. They tend to call themselves stupid and negatively self-talk, or struggle with depression.

Surround her with as many things that are familiar and memory-encouraging as possible. Encourage her to continue to engage in the hobbies she is able to. If you know that there are things that frustrate her more than give her enjoyment, avoid these, or try to figure out a way to adapt them. Reminisce, reminisce, reminisce. Do your best to engage her in conversation about things she will remember better. Ask her to tell you stories of going back to school and other parts of her life she is most proud of. If you have access to it, or a family member does, put together a ""memory book"" and organize her pictures for her, with labels. I don't know what amateur radio is, but could you burn some content of things she would've played or listened to on CDs for her? Be mindful of the way you talk to her, shorter sentences, less colloquial terms or expressions etc. If she has a hard time comprehending your speech, it will make her feel as though she is stupid.

If it appeals to her, encourage creativity. It will become harder for her to think abstractly as the disease progresses, but for some intellectuals, this is a great outlet. Sketchbook and pencils, or a journal to write in. We have a resident at work that is in love with coloring [mandalas](https://www.google.ca/search?q=mandalas+to+color&amp;hl=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QhfKUqW1JcOdyQHWwYHYCw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=619). It's soothing, relaxing and cognitively stimulating. 


Pride is a big issue with this demographic. Let her do everything she can independently, as the self-aware folks are very mindful of you hovering over them or trying to do too much for them. Task breakdown charts may seem demeaning to some, but they are very helpful for individuals who need extra prompting to do things independently, without desiring supervision and verbal prompts. I'm not sure how the disease is manifesting with her, but if she's struggling with fine motor skills, look into adaptive eating utensils. If she gets lost easily, make some attractive but easy-to-read signs to hang up to point her to the bathroom etc. 

Having Alzheimer's Disease is exhausting. Encourage a short afternoon nap, so that she will wake up feeling a bit refreshed and more able to handle afternoon and evening tasks like eating dinner without frustration. The evenings are when they find themselves often struggling most, when sundowning starts.

"We moved Mother-in-law (74)  into a memory care facility after father-in-law passed away. In retrospect, we wish we had done so earlier, but FIL was adamant that he could care for her on his own, and pushed everyone away. FIL exhausted himself managing her care round the clock, and we believe that hastened his own physical decline and resulted in his death.

When FIL went into the hospital, we first hired caregivers (3 for 3 shifts) to come into her home, but quickly discovered the caregivers were unreliable and leaving before their shift ended, leaving MIL unattended for who knows how long. Next, we took MIL into our own house to care for her. But we quickly realized it took three able-bodied adults to manage her care - and the three of us we were barely managing at that!

Her sleep schedule was all messed up, so someone had to be awake all night long to ensure she wouldn't get up and wander or leave the house. She needed constant, round-the-clock supervision - you could not turn your back on her for even a moment. It's like having a toddler but worse, because you can't put them in a  pack &amp; play temporarily, or tuck them away safely in  a crib to sleep. 

It quickly became clear to us that it was an untenable situation -- and heartbreaking to realize this is what ran FIL's health into the ground.    Her care took more than one caregiver at a time. She needed to be in a lock down facility so she couldn't wander out and into the street. Cabinets needed to be locked so she couldn't get into the medicine and overdose. And yes stairs were indeed a hazard. Getting her showered &amp; toileting was a major task requiring more than one person. Etc, etc.... 

It took some time for MIL to adjust to her new home, the memory care facility. She used to be a nurse so she is under the illusion that she's not a patient there, she's a nurse. Or sometimes she tells us she is visiting her father, who has been dead for decades. But, she does not ask to go back home. In fact, the day we moved her into the facility, she had a brief moment of lucidity during which she said to me, ""It's okay. I did not feel safe in my house. It's too much for me to manage. I know I need to be here. I don't like it, but I know it's time, and it's for the best.""

I don't think it's necessary to know exactly which brain disorder she suffers from, but since you mention hallucinations, you may want to rule out UTI. MIL had a UTI as a result of her dementia (i.e., she'd forget what she was doing in the bathroom; lack of good hygiene resulted in a UTI). Clearing up the UTI did make an improvement in her dementia, but only so much. She stopped having hallucinations (such as thinking an umbrella was a snake), but continues to confabulate (thinks that she's a nurse not a patient). Also MIL has epilepsy, has had it since she was a teenager. The dementia caused her to forget to take her medicine, which in turn, would cause seizures, which in turn, resulted in further decline. Now that she's in long term facility, she is taking her meds on schedule, so she has settled into a ""baseline."" I.e., she's not going to improve from this baseline, but decline may have slowed. 

I would take your mom to a doctor and have her evaluated. It can help to reassure you that you are doing the right thing by your mom. These are such difficult and emotional decisions. If the doctor says it's time for a facility, that will ease your own burden making the tough decision.

I'll make that suggestion to those that are with her... that they have her do stuff and things with her hands.  Folding laundry, I think she can do that.  Maybe shelling peas or something like that.

I was just hoping that, if she had a part in making the notebook, that she might remember making it and not think that people were keeping the truth from her or doing things like not telling her about the funeral.  My family is very attentive to her and would never do something like that to her and I know that she knows that.

Most of the time, she's blissfully ignorant.  But, she knows he's gone and she just seems to be under the impression that he has left her because she hasn't seen him in X weeks.  To me, that seems worse than the fact that he passed away.  So, she can be momentarily redirected, but what remains is still the question of where is he?  Why has he left me?  Do you think, if she hears it enough, that he hasn't left her, but simply passed away, that it will stick and she can get to a point where she remembers it and doesn't think that he just left her?

Part of me thinks that there is some sort of cognitive dissonance.  Somewhere in there she knows that he passed away, but doesn't want to know it.  Then, because she doesn't know it, she asks or looks in the notebook.  She sees what she doesn't want to know, and forgets it.  Like a loop.

I know that there is no easy answer.  I'm kind of just publicly ""thinking out loud"".  I'll take you up on your PM offer if I have a concrete question.  Thanks internet stranger :)

"I'm so sorry that you're in this situation. It's not easy for anyone, and there's simply not enough help out there for those in situations like yours.

If your mom wants nothing to do with the man she divorced, how can she expect you to? To me, that seems very unfair. 

These situations are so much more complicated than one can state in six paragraphs, but based on what you've written (that he was an abusive father, that you're estranged) I would say that you do not have any obligation to take care of him. That said, if your conscience tells you that you must do something, then do something. Your involvement can be as little or as much as you'd like it to be.

It doesn't sound like your father is going to be able to go home, which is probably a blessing for you. Since he is mentally unstable, it is better for him to live in a facility than at home where he can be a danger to others. If you have the option of putting him in a nursing home and having the state pay for it, that sounds like a pretty good solution--again, I'm not sure what your circumstances are.

The bottom line is that you are young, you're on your way to building a good life. It doesn't sound like your father took stellar care of you when you were growing up, and I would say you shouldn't feel obligated to be there for him now. Do what you can so your heart and mind are at peace, but don't give up more than you want to. Good luck, I wish you the best.

"In two years since official diagnosis of dementia for my father.   They say that once diagnosed you can look back over the previous 5 years and take account of some the strange things that the patient may have done ... and blame the dementia for it.  My dad would come back from work, close the garage door and not come in for 15 minutes.  Turns out he was touching up the car from parking lot scratches (he was the cause of, I can safely guess).   He worked with colors/art in his job... he had to do more and more re-do's to correct the mistakes.  In retrospect, through all his complaining those years I consider his boss to be a very patient person.  Two years and such decline.  Now he sees aliens, cannot identify himself in pictures, reaches out to shake his own hand in the mirror ... and asked me the other day to kill him as he cannot take it anymore.  It is the saddest, most terrifying transformation I have seen and because it is somebody I love it is even more painful.  I have been supporting my mother as a caretaker but suggesting for a long time to get an in-house aid.  She agreed to it last month but she feels her home is uncomfortable by the new person.  My father gets agitated when the caretaker comes in.  Hygiene is gone.  The cruel trick is that there are moments when, although far from who he was, his old personality, humor, references, acknowledgements come forth.  My mother and I look at each other and think maybe he has returned, maybe we should hold off on placing him assisted living.  But the moment passes, he punches the walls, his legs, curses, is given some seraquel and fades off to sleep.  He gets admitted this Thursday.  We have feelings of relief and guilt and loss and resignation.  I see my mother crying, entering a new foreign stage of life without her husband to wake up to.  My father will probably never see the house, the backyard,  some of his pets ever again.  It makes me break down sometimes to see that this man who I idolized come to this sad fate.

"I feel the struggle. We had this issue with my grandmother in the last several months. The best thing we did was go with her to help her with her balance and keeping her on track. We bought flushable wipes to help her clean herself. We eventually had to wipe for her. However, we used some womens large poise pads (for dribbles) and depends at night. This helped at least so that we could help keep her clean when she had accidents at the toilet. We also tried to ask her frequently if she needed to go to the bathroom when we were out.  She would forget she needed to go and it would be too late. It might be beneficial to try to keep her clothing simple, such as elastic pants and not as many zippers or buttons. Try to ask her to pull the undies and pants down before she tries to sit down (the issue with my grandma would be she would get it halfway down her butt before she started to sit down, so she ended up sitting on her underwear as she went to the bathroom.

What DID help, was a ""second"" opinion from a doctor or priest. Some people often exhibit some kind of authority, and some people tend to follow their ""orders"".

"So- first, I'm sorry that your family is going through this.  I'm going to be blunt: it will not get better.  I've said similar things in this thread before, but it is impractical for your dad to live with a family member under these circumstances.  It will completely disrupt the life of the relative/ primary caregiver.  You guys are not equipped to manage the type of behavior that he is demonstrating.  Look at the meds:  what if next time he takes all the sleeping pills?  
A quick thought:  if his behavior has been ok and just recently got much worse, there may be a medical reason for that and with a medical intervention he may bounce back.   During my dad's rather quick journey from independence to incapacitation (only about 3 years) there were quick dips in his behavior / cognitive function.  We could trace some of those to medical causes like a UTI and with medication, he would get a bit better. 
Another cause of the quick decline could be the meds themselves:  I'm no expert, but I know that many antiseizure meds can have a sedating effect which can exacerbate some symptoms of dementia (the can also curb some of the symptoms).
If this level of function is your dad's new baseline, you should explore the following options based upon your financial status:  you can private pay for round the clock aides to come into your/your aunt's house and care for him.  This gets expensive and often aides will still defer to the cognizant relative, even when your trying to defer to them!  You could look into assisted living facilities- many now have a dementia or special care unit.  Often this is private pay assisted living and gets very expensive and they can kick him out for any minor behavior-   It happened to my dad.   Finally there are ""skilled nursing facilities"". Many take Medicaid or Medicare-  just google the ones in your area and go visit to make sure they look ok.  Good luck-   I don't know what state your dad loves in, but if you need more help, let me know.   My family has been going through this for a couple of years now, we moved my dad across the country to be closer to my brothers and I.  My mom moved in with my wife and me and we moved my dad from home where he was very unsafe, into an Alzheimer's unit of assisted living.   They kicked him out after less then a month and we've been stuck in a terrible limbo of hospitalization a and overmedication ever since.   We finally got him into a skilled nursing facility that will agree to reduce his meds somewhat.   Now the state insurance paperwork begins.   Good luck.

"You could do it the hard way and just shut down his account. I'm pretty sure you can do this on most services somewhere in the settings.

But if you really don't want him to know, another option is to ask the family and friends that receive these e-mails, to block him. Mark him as spam or send him to another inbox altogether.

I'm sure you have already tried to explain to them why he does this, but don't be vague about it. Some people think dementia is just something that happens to all old people, or that it gets better after a while, or that it's not as bad as you say it is. Put it in black and white: This is a disease that **will** kill him, the reason he's doing these things is not out of spite, but because he's a dying man who doesn't know better (literally, those nerve cells are gone).

My dad passed away almost a year ago from Lewybody dementia, so if you have any questions, just send me a message. I hope I didn't sound too harsh, it's a tough road you're going down.

"1. Make sure it's not thrush - double-check and just be sure that there aren't white spots or coating on the tongue. Is it kind of black or brown? Look far back, not just at the tip of the tongue. I know he just went to the dentist, but double-check and check regularly.
2. Is his mouth really dry? If so, try something like biotene or another product intended for xerostomia. Is his tongue really red, almost pink? Cracked? Can you see ropey spit in his mouth? 
3. Can he smell the food being prepared? If not, try and make smell happen before taste happens. Prime the system.
4. Does the food look appealing, or is the meal time setting somewhat social and enjoyable?
5. Test the following: sweet, sour, cold, hot, textures. See if there is anything at all that makes a difference. For example, ice cream (cold and sweet), gingerale (carbonated and sweet), lemon, etc.

I can't stress the smell thing enough (3). It may sound strange, but priming is a real thing, and it's often a good thing to use with people with dementia.

"&gt;Will he have to stop working? 

Yes, he will.  We can't predict when that will be and neither can his doctors, really.  It's a very case by case basis.

&gt;Will he eventually forget who I am?

Maybe.  Maybe not.  Again this is  a case by case basis.
 
&gt;Will he need a care taker? 

Probably. But again, when exactly that point comes isn't something we can predict.

&gt;How long before he is gone? 

Early onset dementia is often very aggressive.  There might not be a whole lot of time before he is unable to care for himself.  You should be worrying about this now.  

But he might be physically around for a very long time, if he doesn't have or develop other outstanding health conditions

There are things you need to do more immediately.  Take steps to ensure the success of the family business without him in the picture.  Make sure you, or someone else trustworthy are his power of attorney because you will need it.  

But lots of it, is really a wait and see game.  There are medications that can help slow the process down.  It's a constantly changing battle when you're the primary care taker.

cure-alzheimers.org is a website that provides free information, blog posts, and interesting news about alzheimer's and other relevant information such as dementia, and interesting stories about people / families who have/have had the disease.

Why the newsletter? We share personal stories of people in the free newsletter. We also like to keep people updated about the news for a cure on alzheimers. We search the web daily. And also provide people with download links to free content such as ebooks and video tutorials. 

Im upset to hear that because we are based in the Philippines you have thought of us as a shady operation...

The personal experience I have experienced with Alzhiemer's is only of one of my relatives. He is currently afflicted by Alzheimer's, and is nearing the end stages of the disease.... 

We made this blog because we feel personally committed to the cause. We make the links to point to the cure alzheimers fund. in the newsletter we regularly encourage people to donate to them and also inform people of other Alzheimers research funds as well.",false,false,t1_cmzl2u2,curealzheimers,,0,1419000656,t5_2rfqf,t3_2prpfj,t1_cmzgsge,0,1425317774,0,0,cmzl2u2,dementia,0,,,

"I know I'm a little late here, but my grandma has pretty severe dementia, and it's spiraling very rapidly. It's been very hard on the family, and at times I know it's been difficult for  my husband to know exactly how to deal with it. We're an emotional mess, and at times I'll pick him up from work in tears - it's not easy losing the one you love even though physically they're in fine health. I would just say ask her how she's doing, let her talk about it, let her be sad, let her be unhappy. It's a horrible situation, and causes so much suffering. I think the best thing you can do is just talk about it with her. If she mentions it, know that she is wanting to talk about it and engage in conversation. It's a very unpleasant subject, especially when you're talking about symptoms that can seem humorous (i.e. my grandma tried calling my aunt on a banana), but know that it's a heartbreaking thing to see someone who previously was whip smart and feisty as hell reduced to a child-like state.

My father in law had gotten so bad and he was mean. I know it wasn't ethical but we had no option. We got his signature on a power of attorney trading it for a candy bar. But then I was able to care for him at home and deal with him. The funny thing is once he realized he was safe and didn't have to make any decisions and I would take care of him he got a lot less mean. The mean comes from being afraid. They know something is wrong, in denial, and takes it out on others. He died at home the way he wanted and the last month actually said thank you to me. Floored me!

"I agree with the comments saying to look after yourself.

I don't know where you're from OP, but if you're from the UK then the [Alzheimer's Society](http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=2234) has some really useful tips and advice (also applicable for those outside of the UK.) See if you can get in touch with them if you're local though, they can help you get in touch with others who have been through the same thing and give you a lot of advice. 

Remember that you need to look after yourself, the advice from the Alzheimer's Society is the same. If you're not well then you can't be a good friend or carer to your nana. Make sure you're eating properly, try to get some exercise or at least some fresh air regularly. I find walks help clear the head too. Even if you're not her main carer and you're not with her 24/7 it can be a difficult thing to internalise and deal with. Remember that you are not alone. 

If you ever need someone to speak to, send me a PM. I'm a mental health nurse in the UK, I've worked for 2 years closely with people with dementia and their families and I suffer with depression myself. Although I can't promise I can help, I can always listen - as a friend :)

"You start with one substance at a time, for a week, and document its effect. These things can have different effects on different folks.  After some experimentation, I came to the conclusion that the most important criterion for me to establish was whether a given chemical stimulated me or made me tired, brain fogged, etc.

Simplest Noots are Caffeine (coffee) + L-Theanine.  Caffeine stimulates, Theanine is an anxiolytic.

Next step I tried was Acetyl L-Carnitine (ALCAR) and Choline (eggs)  - this forms AcetylCholine, a very important neurochemical.

Thereafter I started to experiment with the Racetams (peptides), and other stims like Modafinil, which worked for me. I tried weed once or twice in my early life and hated the effects.  have not tried mushrooms either.
I smoked for many years, so know how strong of a stim nicotine can be.  I quit smoking when i retired, but still use a 7mg patch on my upper arm if I need to really focus and concentrate.

The medical community does not have much to offer all round, except in my case, Modafinil.  Most of the other stuff I take is OTC.

The longer one waits, the less effect things like this have.  I wish I had started five years earlier, I might still have a job.

"In two years since official diagnosis of dementia for my father.   They say that once diagnosed you can look back over the previous 5 years and take account of some the strange things that the patient may have done ... and blame the dementia for it.  My dad would come back from work, close the garage door and not come in for 15 minutes.  Turns out he was touching up the car from parking lot scratches (he was the cause of, I can safely guess).   He worked with colors/art in his job... he had to do more and more re-do's to correct the mistakes.  In retrospect, through all his complaining those years I consider his boss to be a very patient person.  Two years and such decline.  Now he sees aliens, cannot identify himself in pictures, reaches out to shake his own hand in the mirror ... and asked me the other day to kill him as he cannot take it anymore.  It is the saddest, most terrifying transformation I have seen and because it is somebody I love it is even more painful.  I have been supporting my mother as a caretaker but suggesting for a long time to get an in-house aid.  She agreed to it last month but she feels her home is uncomfortable by the new person.  My father gets agitated when the caretaker comes in.  Hygiene is gone.  The cruel trick is that there are moments when, although far from who he was, his old personality, humor, references, acknowledgements come forth.  My mother and I look at each other and think maybe he has returned, maybe we should hold off on placing him assisted living.  But the moment passes, he punches the walls, his legs, curses, is given some seraquel and fades off to sleep.  He gets admitted this Thursday.  We have feelings of relief and guilt and loss and resignation.  I see my mother crying, entering a new foreign stage of life without her husband to wake up to.  My father will probably never see the house, the backyard,  some of his pets ever again.  It makes me break down sometimes to see that this man who I idolized come to this sad fate.

I totally went beyond your question, sorry.  Prep as much as you can.  Get into a support group, find people who can truly understand not just be empathetic.

"I am a bit late to the dance since I see that your post is over 3 months old.

First of all, I am so very sorry that you and your family are going through this. It is not a fate I would wish on anyone.

My dad has vascular dementia and I have been caring for him for over a year now. He and my mother were both diagnosed the same week, vascular dementia in his case and Alzheimer's mixed dementia in hers. Some of the symptoms are different, but the inevitable downward spiral is similar.

Mom deteriorated very, very quickly and we had to place her in a nursing home. She's been there for almost a year and to her, it's been just a few days.

The most important advice I can give you is to look after yourself. Being a caregiver is incredibly stressful and you are going to need help. We live in Canada and are fortunate to have a health care system that provides some help. There are wonderful nurses who come three times a week to help with personal care (bathing and grooming). I don't know what services are available to you, but I do encourage you to get on the phone and ask lots of questions. It was quite a trip to find the right people to talk to in order to get help.

I am far from being an authority on dementia but I do know a heck of a lot about being a caregiver. So if you think I can be of any help, just ask.",false,true,t1_cj2lqxr,empressmichelle,,0,1405871763,t5_2rfqf,t3_22z6wr,t3_22z6wr,1,1434806751,0,0,cj2lqxr,dementia,1,,,

"I am so sorry for all of you whose parent lashes out in anger or violence because of the dementia. My mother, fortunately, never did (perhaps because she'd dished out all her anger and violence while I was growing up ?). But it's common, I know. In retrospect, her early symptoms were those little habits that gradually progressed from quaint idiosyncrasies to exasperating behaviors. For example, EVERY time I called home she insisted on asking me what long-distance service I was using - and how much it was costing me. No matter how recently I'd told her I had unlimited long-distance. 

Oh, and she'd always have ice cream for my kids when we'd visit - but then she would give them seconds... and I had to intervene when she and my toddler were headed back into the kitchen for a THIRD ice cream cone.

That's when the kids were told that Grandma saying so no longer counted as permission. :-) (She herself also started eating sweets in abundance, no longer inhibited by the careful self-discipline she'd practiced as long as I could remember.)

"I completed a social work internship working with dementia patients and helping family members with situations just like this one. One thing to keep in mind with your grandmother is that dementia attacks the brain, so what sounds logical to you may be immensely confusing for her. I can tell that you're being very gentle and empathetic with her which is great! 

I usually found with patients who had recently lost a spouse, redirection was key. It is difficult on family members to 'lie' to their loved ones especially on things as important as this, but by making little white lies you can make your grandmother's moment to moment experience so much better. Rather than replying directly when she asks about your grandfather, perhaps you could say something like, 'I'm not sure where he is right now,' (which is partially true) and then redirect to something more positive. Talking about older memories, recounting how the two of them met, or asking her about topics she still is good at discussing are always good. Also tactile activities may spur her memories and give her a feeling of accomplishment and self worth--laundry or painting are both good tactile options.

"It matters what type of dementia your mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother had. It's possible they did not all have the same type, and would not have had the same cause.

My own mother had a non-Alzheimer's type of dementia, most similar to Frontal-Temporal-Lobe Degeneration (aka 'FTD'). The risk of developing that type of dementia isn't something that can be (at least to the best of our knowledge at the moment) reduced or delayed with diet/exercise/brain-activity. My mother was so careful about her nutrition and health. Her body was fine - but her brain just slowly melted away despite all her preventive efforts. She died at age 69; in retrospect her symptoms had begun emerging around age 60.

Here's what I am doing/plan to do to cope with the possibility that I might meet the same fate:

Fortunately my kids were old enough to be aware of what was happening to their grandmother in those last years of her life and I've talked to them about the possibility that the same thing will happen to me. They'll be prepared if and when I start losing my executive-level functioning.

I'm going to get long-term-care insurance when I'm still young enough for it to be affordable. And BEFORE i get any kind of diagnosis.

I'm enjoying my life - living mindfully, appreciating the moments, savoring the little details. I eat donuts. And chocolate. And red meat. My mother spent so many years denying herself the small pleasures in life - I'm not going to make that same mistake.

"The overly-dramatic accusation is denial or ignorance.  When a great-aunt got dementia I didn't know enough about the disease to recognize it.  I wound up seeing her for a holiday meal and thought ""I don't really see why they have her in a home, she sees pretty normal to me.""  I hadn't seen her in a decade, I talked to her only briefly, and I didn't see the mistakes she may have made outside of conversion: driving, bathing, dressing, eating, finances, etc.  Fast forward a few years and a couple of my closer relatives develop dementia.  I get the full extent then and start having to make major decisions for one of the older relatives.  But it took me personally being involved to see what dementia really looks like and how serious it is. 

As far as your other problems go, you have to take a step back and look at your situation as an outsider.  Your immediate family is care-giving, so it's common to develop resentment to those in your family that aren't.  But you can't force other people to live their lives the way you want them to.  When my relative was in an assisted living facility home I saw a lot of variation in how often people visited.  I'd say most visitors came by weekly to monthly, there were the rare people that would visit a parent or spouse twice daily, some came very infrequently.  Uncle 1 sounds like he visited a reasonable amount for his life situation.  Yeah, uncles 2 &amp; 3 could visit more, but the amount they're visiting isn't out of the norm.  Plus, I don't know if there was some strained relationship before the dementia.  How does the amount they're visiting now compare to how often they visited when she was healthy?

As far as including grandma in all events, drop it.  People should be allowed to have birthday parties for their kids where they want.  Sometimes it will not be possible or practical to include grandma.  I don't see why your cousin has to put her life on hold for grandma when she's already balancing 5 of her own children.

"I don't have much in the way of advice, but I can tell you what you describe are familiar reactions to this disease-- It is about acceptance, or the lack of, really. On the one hand you have those that are absent because not being there is easier than seeing the reality of her decline.  And the on the other hand are those whose denial takes the form of minimizing the problems, and blocking out how far along things really are.  Neither of these are great stances of course, but none the less it is how they are coping with something they are uncomfortable with, and maybe seeing it like that might help some in your dealings with them.

She called me &amp;amp; my Sis  &amp;amp; talked crazy non-stop, like she was mad at the world, &amp;amp; kept threatening to walk down the street &amp;amp; run out in front of traffic. Intermittently, she went off into another zone of her mind &amp;amp; babbled incoherently non stop. It took 2 tries to have her committed. The first time, an ambulance came, but couldn't force her to go with them. The second time, we had to go sign papers at a sheriff office &amp;amp; give reasons for the need to have her committed, then trick her into a fake appointment to get her into the emergency room where the psych dr from the mental ward came &amp;amp; met my Mom. A few minutes in at the ER, Mom started babbling again. They took her up to the mental ward immediately. Call your nearest psych hospital &amp;amp; ask what steps you'll need to take. 
I got Durable Power of Attorney for my parents after they were in a nursing home. My Mom already had advanced Alzheimer's &amp;amp; could barely sign her name, &amp;amp; didn't question it.

"I praise your desire to do something good, so please don't think my comments are attacking you or your heartfelt efforts, but I see a ton of flaws in this approach, so I gotta get this off my chest:

Crowdfunding is fine if you have a product or piece of art, but it's a severely flawed way to fund research.

Whether it's Alzheimer's, Cancer, Heart Disease or any other, there's always someone ranting about the need to remove overhead, cut the middleman and just throw money at a researcher. This thought process is severely flawed and an insult to the hardworking folks in the public and nonprofit sectors who specialize in confronting those diseases. It also discredits the various other needs in the disease space on which donations are spent, such as services, programs, awareness and advocacy.

Those ""administrative expenses"" you cite are often dollars spent to pay groups of dedicated professionals with specialized skills who perform a myriad of duties all devoted to conquering a disease, some at significantly lower salaries than they'd receive elsewhere. Many of them work to provide programs &amp; services (education, support, housing, food prep, etc.) Others are communications specialists, who use their skills to hone messaging to be more relevant to folks, thus increasing awareness of a disease, knowledge of its effects, and persuading folks to care about that disease. Some folks work the political angles, helping pass legislation that affects large swaths of the population. Some help manage all those other folks. Additionally, there are teams of knowledgeable experts (doctors, researchers, etc) that work to make the best determination of how to prioritize limited resources.

Think about it. Let's say you raise $1 million. Who do you give the $$ to? Is it scientist A or B? What if you give it to B, but his research is shoddy or his hypothesis is flawed? What if the greater scientific community NEEDs the results of A's study? You just wasted money, and in a far worse way than the organizations you're criticizing. Who handles oversight of your decision-making process? How are your ethical standards derived? How much experience do you have in this field? Why should anyone trust that your decisions will be better than the organizations that have been instrumental in making progress against their respective diseases. (Alzheimer's Association or American Cancer Society, Heart Association, et al)

1 quick anecdote specific to Alzheimer's. Federal funding for Alzheimer's disease hadn't risen in nearly a decade and was hovering around $400 million/year. The Alzheimer's Association ran a series of aggressive advocacy campaigns, conducted thousands of meetings with elected officials, did a ton of public outreach/messaging and held a ton of events over the course of a few years and BOOM, $40 million in new funds for Alzheimer's research &amp; programs was added to the budget for the National Institutes of Health last year and $122 million this year. It wouldn't have happened without that organization, period. No other group did (or can do) anywhere near what they did (though some try to take credit). 

How long will it take a crowd-funded campaign to get $122 million? Answer: FOREVER
And what accountability is there? 
Answer: Little to none

Lastly, is ""a cure"" the actual next step? Don't we need a ton of stuff in between where we are now and a final cure? methods to detect the disease, more knowledge of the disease, ways to prevent it, drugs to offset it's effects, a vaccine, etc. Those might actually be easier to obtain and save lives while we continue searching for a cure. Shouldn't those efforts get funding?

So first off I'm so sorry. My dads 60 (I'm 21) and he is in the final stages of dementia currently. It is so hard hearing a diagnosis, and not knowing what it really means.

Anyhow, dementia varies greatly depending on the type, person, age, etc. Sadly, usually the earlier a person gets it, the more aggressive it is.

My dad ran a multi-million dollar business up until 5 years ago when he was diagnosed. The one piece of advice I have is that you need to pay attention to his decisions a bit more. We found out my dad made some poor purchases and lost the businesses a significant amount of money. It is easy to ignore, but since he is in control of a major company it is something that needs to be considered.

"..that's beyond my realm of experience. Find out if the hospital she goes to has Adult Services and, if they do, speak to one of the social workers for advice; usually they've encountered similar things in the past and can provide good suggestions regarding which approach might work best for a particular situation. To the best of my knowledge, doing so won't put her at risk of her being forcibly taken and made a ward of the state, but you can check anyway. Also, the company I work for provides for counseling services (for advice) through an FMLA program, so find out if any of the brothers or the sister has access to that.
