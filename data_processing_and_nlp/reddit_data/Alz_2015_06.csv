"As /u/myfeelingsarehurt pointed out, it quickly becomes more about happiness than correctness.  What I learned going through this process with my mom is that what is happening around her becomes less about what is happening and more about how it makes her feel.  For example, when watching a movie or tv show with my mom she has no idea what's going on; she can't follow the conversations but she can follow the emotions.  She loves going to the movies not because of the plot but because it's fun to hang out with family and the movies are fun (we would only go see funny or uplifting movies).  As with many Alzheimer's patients, music is huge for my mom.  She doesn't remember who most people are but still remembers lyrics to her favorite songs and music makes her incredibly happy.

You are going to get frustrated and angry sometimes.  Don't be too hard on yourself about that ... those are natural emotions and dealing with this is going to be beyond difficult.  It's going to be a learning process for you in how to deal with it.  I certainly went through all the stages of grief after the diagnosis.

I read the book Still Alice and it gave me pretty good insight into how it feels for my mom, and the progression.  It's not a ""how to"" book but I recommend it.  The movie was okay but I think the book has much more impact, especially for someone like you who is going through it with a loved one.  If you are interested there are quite a few ""how to"" and what to expect type of books out there that provide a lot of information.  

I recommend you get the Power of Attorney (and Medical Power of Attorney) taken care of as soon as possible.  It shouldn't take effect until a doctor says so (at least that's how my mom's was) but it's important to do now so that there are no questions about her cognitive ability at the time she signed it.  The will is important too but POA is most important in my opinion.  Note that I'm not an attorney though so you should seek legal advice.  I don't know much about the effectiveness of the online POAs you can get but it's important enough that I think talking to a lawyer about it is worth it.  I think we paid 400 or less for the POA from an attorney.

Another big suggestion, once you take over finances, make sure you document everything and keep careful track of how things are spent.  My mom went on social security and I receive the money in a special payee account.  I keep a spreadsheet of how the money is spent and that makes filling out the report at the end of the year much easier.  My biggest regret is not keeping track of the money I've personally spent on my mom's care.  When she eventually goes on medicaid, some of the money will likely be counted as a ""gift"" when in fact it was spent on her.  Not a huge deal, but it's something I wish I'd kept track of.",false,false,t1_cs3uu8k,kadenz,,0,1434079063,t5_2r8fp,t3_39h8qd,t3_39h8qd,3,1436929269,0,0,cs3uu8k,Alzheimers,3,,

"It really is. You have started talking. That's important. I used total legal (website) it wasn't free but cheap and convenient. You can set them up according to you wishes and get them notarized. It's important to get it at some point because it can be tricky later once she is more affected its not legal for her to sign rights away. I suggest offering to let her keep them in her possession for now until they are needed. Important to make sure you (or who ever has POA) know where they are. 

You have a bit of time here, so don't let this issue strain the relationship. Your relationship and your and her happiness are key. Try to set up a support system for both of you now. Regular meetings or lunches with friends and family. 

I have noticed (this could just be in our case) that setting up a routine can help a person with dementia. We set up routines around meds and other important things long before they were needed. Now that the dementia has set in, there are fewer struggles over things that have been done for a while. This takes the patience of the person with Alzheimer's, once again happiness is more important than routine but if you can set up a few it will help.

"Many of these genes do indeed control pathways that contribute to neuronal plasticity and regeneration, but under conditions of oxidative stress lead to cognitive impairment and the death of neurons.

Some animals, such as dogs and cats, also suffer from cognitive dysfunction.  The following observation about the treatment of canine dysfunction also applies to human beings with Alzheimer's disease.

Decline in cognitive functions that accompany aging in dogs may have a biological basis, and many of the disorders associated with aging in canines may be mitigated through dietary modifications that incorporate specific nutraceuticals. Based on previous research and the results of both laboratory and clinical studies – antioxidants may be one class of nutraceutical that provides benefits to aged dogs. Brains of aged dogs accumulate oxidative damage to proteins and lipids, which may lead to dysfunction of neuronal cells. The production of free radicals and lack of increase in compensatory antioxidant enzymes may lead to detrimental modifications to important macromolecules within neurons. Reducing oxidative damage through food ingredients rich in a broad spectrum of antioxidants significantly improves, or slows the decline of, learning and memory in aged dogs. However, determining all effective compounds and combinations, dosage ranges, as well as when to initiate intervention and long term effects constitute gaps in our current knowledge.

"The key to this is oxidative stress.  As long as oxidants are being scavenged, it does not matter how many amyloid plaques or neurofibrillary tangles a person has in their brain, they will not develop Alzheimer's disease.

THC and cannabidiols in marijuana scavenge peroxynitrites--a potent oxidation that damages receptors, transport systems, tissue, and neurons in the brain.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14578199

In Alzheimer's disease, peroxynitrites inhibit the synthesis and release of neurotransmitters involved in short-term memory, sleep, mood, social recognition, and alertness, inhibit the flow of blood and the transport of glucose in the brain which can cause delusions, prevent the regeneration of neurons in the hippocampus, and contribute to the death of neurons.  Part of this damage can be reversed by peroxynitrite scavengers.

Marijuana has the advantage of being inhaled into the brain (aromatherapy with essential oils high in eugenol--another peroxynitrite scavenger--also fits into this category).
