"I do not understand. If the drug is doing nothing for cognition anymore, even if it ever did, why would taking your mom off the Revistigamine cause a precipitous immediate decline in cognition? Especially if it never did anything for her to begin with.

"&gt;Medicare and his secondary insurance do not seem to cover anything beyond skilled nursing after an inpatient stay? 

This is true. That is all they cover until your dad needs hospice. Then in order for Medicare to pay for hospice, you dads doctor will have to say he only has 6 months to live. 

&gt;The VA seems a viable option 

VA is your best option however, how much they will help with depends on your fathers income and some assets. It takes a while to get signed up for VA help. I would suggest you start that process asap. The VA also helps the spouse of a veteran as much as the veteran themselves. You may want to get your mom signed up for financial help with the VA also. The VA, Medicare, and disability works the same no matter where you parents live. The local contacts would change.

Here are a couple resources that may help.

"I Heard a podcast recently that addressed this very issue. I think it was This American Life, I will try to find it. Anyway, the ""old thinking"" is that you need to remind Alzheimer's patients constantly of where they are and how things are. However, lately, more providers are finding that it does make patients happier to live in their reality, and go along with whatever they are experiencing. The story specifically told of a woman who was mainly being cared by her son in law, who was an improv actor, and applied the same theory of ""always say 'yes, and'"" to a scene partner, only to his mother in law. She seemed very happy to be around him and recognized him as a friend and someone she enjoyed, even if she didn't always know who he was. So, I think it is just fine to do what you are doing.

"Hi, Im a PhD student trying to find a treatment for Alzheimer's disease currently, and my grandpa had the disease, so I know what youre going through. 

I'll try to answer a couple of your questions for you:

First of all, the reason that we want to slow the progression is to give the patient and their family the longest amount of time with the most cognitive ability. Thats the PR answer. The bullshit answer. The honest answer is that we, as a society, have decided that prolonging life is always the best course, regardless of quality of life. Thats why medically assisted suicide is still illegal. Its why we do a large number of the treatments we do for the elderly or for end-stage patients of any number of diseases and illnesses.

But it's important to remember that we are constantly working to find new drugs. The fact is, the drugs we have now suck. they do nothing, really. They slow the symptoms, briefly, but then they stop working, and the underlying disease has been progressing all the while.

I say this not to get you down... perhaps I should be more PC, but I feel you deserve the honest truth. This is also the same truth that drives me and thousands of other researchers around the world to find better drugs. and were close. I know its a shitty consolation to your mothers health. It doesnt help me deal with the memories I have of my grandfathers deterioration. But we **will** find a treatment that can actually slow/stop the progression in a meaningful way. we *will*. And then others will never have to know our suffering.

- Plants to brighten up her room.

-  A fish tank can be great stimulation, and they're low maintenance. 

-  If she is the nurturing sort, a baby doll and/or lifelike stuffed animal may be nice and comforting. 

-  She can look through books of photography (something like this: http://www.amazon.com/Ireland-Visual-Journey-Around-Counties/dp/0717157431/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452635395&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=Photography+Ireland), for something she used to be interested in. 

-  A fiddle box, filled with little items and trinkets that she might like (decorative little makeup mirrors, a pretty ribbon, embroidered handkerchief, etc) 

-  get a big bag of buttons, have her sort them by color or shape 

-  Nature documentaries, as they don't have a plot but are very pretty and visually stimulating 

-  Audio books, if she likes being read to 

-  Pandora station (make one) with music from her teenage years, adolescence, adulthood. If she had a favorite singer or group, play that. 

-  if she is/was religious, church on TV or audio casts/pod casts (something like Joel Osteen, etc)

"My dad has been on it for the last 5 months. And it took maybe a month for it to have a significant impact on his aggressive episodes. It can be used for longer than 12-18 months, however the effectiveness of the medication could decrease as the disease progresses with the possibility of increasing the dose of the medication. But given that your dad is elderly there's always that debate of risks vs benefits with medications. My dad is 53 so quetiapine could also have a different outcome in your dad given the age difference. Ultimately the decision is up to you whether or not you want to try out an anti-psychotic. I would push for low dose, most importantly.

Yes, you can think of it similarly to HIV. Its unlikely that we will ever ""cure"" Alzheimer's disease, similar to cancer, because it is genetic and spontaneously arrises as we age, as opposed to viruses which we can vaccinate against and eliminate completely (like polio).

However, I was recently reading a review article by two of the biggest names in Alzheimer's disease research (Holtzman and Selkoe), and they stated that they believe Alzheimer's will be a treatable disease, much the same as HIV is today, within the next 20 years. Thats obviously speculation, but there are quite literally thousands of scientists trying to find a cure, on top of all the big pharma and biotech companies out there.

"I'm so sorry. It's hard to offer meaningful words of comfort because everyone's situation is different. If your Dad's condition is like my late husband's, then I can say that if you get yourself on his wavelength and ""be here now"" right along with him, you can enjoy many pleasant moments together.

Like many if not most Alzheimer's patients, my husband's decline was very, very gradual. In retrospect I didn't realize at the time how sick he was. I just took each day as it came, making tiny adjustments as occasions cropped up. There were never any major changes in our everyday life, including changes in our financial situation.

I have no other family close by so it was just I who could look after him. Luckily I could work at home, but eventually he needed continuous care so I needed someone to look after him when I needed a break. I engaged a caregiver service to come in for a few hours a couple of times a week, which we could handle by watching our other expenses. If you can work at home and/or have other family members with whom to share the caregiving, you can get by for a long time like this.

I suggest that you join an Alzheimer's caregiver support group. Not only will this give you emotional support, but you'll learn about all of the resources available to you locally. You can find a group by going to your local hospital or by going to alz.org and clicking on ""In My Area"" in the purple banner at the top.

I found much comfort in realizing that my husband's condition was more of a burden to me than it was to him. He didn't know he was sick, and I did everything I could to help him maintain that illusion. When he became unable to follow plot lines or keep track of characters on TV, I gradually transitioned to sports, news, and quiz shows, which he could enjoy because they require no sustained focus. When he needed help getting his socks off, I'd say, ""Oh, how about a nice foot massage?"" I never corrected him or called him on anything he did ""wrong,"" since everything he did was right *for him*. It was impossible to know what his inner life was like, so it made sense to just accept whatever he did as coming from his ""new self"" which was just fine.

All in all, those years were not bad. The hardest part was forgetting what he was like when he was well. But now that he's been gone a while, my memories of him as he was in his prime are starting to supplant my memories of him in those last years.

You obviously love your dad dearly so I'm sure you'll find ways to keep him comfortable and safe. You've already started by reaching out here. You'll get through this, and options for covering the costs will present themselves, you'll see.

"Thanks a lot, your reply helped me a lot to understand what to expect and prepare myself in the future. 

The ""trick"" with the letters, I had thought of something similar, to record him on camera, telling his future self what to do... something like ""Hey me, I know you are frustrated right now, but the argument you are having with your Son/Wife is not really for the best; please just do what they are asking of you"", or something on those lines. But it seemed such a convoluted plan that I'm not sure it would even work, or that I could pull it of. 
Written letters from friends, doctors and other family seems a much better proposition.

But the real problem is still his ""stubbornness"" into shifting his confusion to rage and then lashing at us. We just had another example one hour ago, while we were having dinner and watching a movie, he dropped his drink on himself and his favorite chair; we didn't noticed, because we were all paying attention to the movie, so he just kept there, sitting in a puddle of soft drink for over 10 minutes. When we did notice, in a normal surprised reaction (""Hey, what is this? Why is this all wet?"") he just stands up shouting, throwing his plate and cup on the floor ""you guys just suck, leave me alone!"" and goes to his room... he acts like if it was our fault.

"It's a horrible thing to have to deal with. Sometimes the anger comes from confusion, fear, anxiety, and sometimes it just springs out of nowhere. I would consider talking to his doctor about pharmaceutical options.  While often they are held back due to the possibility of adding confusion, they are often prescribed when the agitation starts to effect daily life. Again this is something for a doctor to decide, but often Ativan or Kolonopin is prescribed. Also right after diagnosis my SO was put on a mild antidepressant. Alzheimer's is strange in that generally speaking it's seen (incorrectly) as a product of being old, and almost just a fact of life. Let's not beat around the bush, Alzheimer's is a deadly disease of which there is no cure. It is a depressing diagnosis both for him and you. 
   
My SO once described the feeling he got on a bad day (early on) he said it was like the morning after drinking a lot, but worse. You wake up and nothing looks right. Your in a bed, but you don't know this bed. The room looks wrong, is it yours? People you don't really know are acting like they are your friends and telling you what to do, you don't really understand what they want, but damn it what gives them the right? 

  All those little annoyances added up combined with the fear you feel when nothing makes sense, turns him into a very angry person. Perhaps it kicks in the ""fight or flight"" response.

"The similarity of AB to LL37 protein, and AB's ability to kill Candida albicans and bacteria suggests that AB has a strong immune function, and is needed in the brain. This now answers my question as to why b-secretase is present at the membrane surface at all. If the amyloidogenic pathway had no value, surely it would have been deleted long ago? Now we can surmise that indeed this pathway has value in creating SOME AB molecules with immune function even in healthy individuals. AD must therefore be caused by an imbalance in this system, creating TOO MANY AB molecules, which disrupt the cleavage of NKAM2.

I definitely suggest music that they like.

My grandma has always loved shopping and general girly things, which I love too so we just talk about those things. Maybe you can find something small in common with her. I find we don't really talk about much as a lot of it gets repeated or off track really quickly so I wouldn't worry about too many awkward silences or general like not socially normal conversational habits.

"First, she needs a thorough medical checkup. There are some medical conditions that can cause dementia-like symptoms, and those need to be ruled out before a diagnosis can be made. Low Vitamin B levels, low oxygen, sleep apnea and more can cause confusion. Additionally, in the elderly, a simple infection like a UTI or kidney infection can cause widespread damage and a lot of confusion, as well. 

That said, assuming it is dementia: 
It sounds like she's having delusions. Delusions are ""false beliefs"" that the patient truly believes are reality. They aren't normal for healthy people, but are very common for people with dementia. All you can really do is try to defuse the situation, calm everyone down, and avoid touchy subjects. People with dementia can't ""listen to reason,"" it just doesn't work. They so firmly believe the delusions that it would be like trying to convince someone the sky is actually purple. It's not worth arguing or getting angry, your energy will only be wasted. 

Is there someone she trusts? A family friend, relative, doctor? You need to get her assessed at a neurologist's office. If you call her primary care doctor, they can do a preliminary assessment, but it might be easier to just go straight to the specialist (depending on whether your insurance requires a referral). They can give you a recommended neuro. Have that trusted friend/family member bring her for an assessment, or have your mother go thinking that it's ""just a checkup."" I wouldn't tell her it's to assess her for dementia, it will likely upset her greatly. You guys need to bite the bullet and get her into a doctor.  She will be angry and embarrassed, but it has to be done, and the sooner the better. Medication, when started early, can help alleviate some of these symptoms. 

Your family will soon be facing a lot of decisions that need to be made. If she is diagnosed, and your father doesn't already have Power of Attorney, someone will have to be responsible for her. They will need Guardianship/Power of Attorney, so that they're legally able to make decisions for her when she's unable to do so. 

Pick up a copy of The 36 Hour Day and start reading. Also look up the Stages of Dementia, and techniques for caregiving for dementia. Teepa Snow videos are particularly helpful in giving advice about how to manage anger, etc.

"Hi there, I'm sorry you have to go through this. His inability to fully comprehend his situation is common. My SO has dementia due to Alzheimer's and this has been a common theme. Do not count on it changing. Do your best to work around it, as you can not argue with dementia. A reasonable logical explanation will not help you. Even if you manage to get him to understand the argument, later he will not be able to remember it. It will set you and him up for frustrating hours/days. 

Unfortunately I can't give you a great deal of help as the work arounds tend to vary from person to person. I have had a few trusted friends and physicians of my SO write letters to him asking him not to do certain things. This accomplishes a couple of things: it keeps me from being the bad guy, and the though of the friend almost sidetracks my SO's train of thought. The fact that they are in writing means he doesn't have to recall a single thing. For instance my SO occasionally wants to drive despite not having a valid license and being incapable of the task.  I have a lovely letter written by one of his best friends asking him not to drive, because she loves him and though he would probably fine, the risk is not worth it. After reading the letter he almost always decides to call and talk to her and the drive he wanted to take is forgotten. Perhaps this could be of help to you? 

Perhaps his primary care provider can refer him to a psychologist or neuro-psychologist? Sometimes just having the suggestion come from someone else is all that needs to happen. Please make sure you have powers of attorney set up for medical and financial decisions. There are even places online you can do them for small fees. They will save you in the future.  


Even if you ignore or find useless everything else I have written please listen to this:
You have a long road ahead of you, it's hard but can also be rewarding. There is no one correct way to care for a Alzheimer's patient, no right answer. The key to being able to care for him is to first and foremost care for yourself. I went 2 years without seeing a doctor after my SO was diagnosed, 2 years without vacation or time off, don't do this to yourself. Do not put your own needs on the backburner or you will not be the caregiver you want to be. When it comes to disagreements with him, especially non vital ones,  it's better that he is happy vs correct. Happiness is hard to come by with this disease.

I believe you should have a discussion with his Primary care physician to see if it's time to call in hospice. Hospice should be covered by his insurance. 

It sounds like he is not mobile enough to go to senior daycare (assuming that he would be willing and non-combative) if there are any in your area. 
The same goes for respite care at a assisted living facility but worth a look. 
  
Has your grandfather served in the military? It's possible he may be able to file for a pension, long process but easy once in place. They do take his income in consideration before giving out a pension but first they subtract out all medical care expenses. 
   
Check out the [community resource finder] (http://www.communityresourcefinder.org) on alz.org. There may be options in your area we are not familiar with. 
   
I have set up volunteers from my life and my SO's life to provide a few hours of respite care a day.  This is not the high level of nursing care you have been getting and shouldn't be considered as replacement for that, but could help to make it so you would need to pay for fewer hours of nursing care. Check with friends of your grandfather and grandmother to see if any of them are able and healthy enough to sit with him one day a week for 3-4 hours. Canvass church members, past coworkers and your friends and coworkers as well. You may be able to set up several days a week where you only have paid caregivers for 4 hours (or whatever their minimum is) and a volunteer for several hours and then yourself.

"Unfortunately, there's no way of telling. My mom sounds like she's at the same stage, about and she's physically healthy, which you don't mention. So mom could easily live another 5 - 7 years.  The disease has, for many people and depending on their physical health when they are diagnosed and after, about a 10 year trajectory, assuming they're diagnosed in the early stages, like my mom. But she's also had a couple of strokes and could die in her sleep tonight.

losing vocabulary, becoming violent, not caring about her family, not recognizing her family are all part of where mom is right now.  

At the very end stages of AD, people forget how to swallow and how to pee - their body forgets how to manage the very processes that are 'normal' to human life. Not many patients get this bad - fewer than 20% from what I've been told. The rest pass before it ever gets here.

I totally understand your frustration. My mom is living like no one should have to live - sad, depressed, anxious and angry, but she's physically incredibly healthy. If the plaque forms in one spot of the brain, she dies. If it forms in a different one, she doesn't. There is no way to know in advance. Therefore, it is paramount for all of us who are family and who love them, to take care of ourselves first and foremost. Sounds awful but my mom doesn't know who I am or how often I visit. I'm her guardian, I have to make sure she's safe and well cared for in the facility where she lives. But I do NOT have to sacrifice my life to her dying process.

I have no control over Alzheimers or her progression. She might live there for 10 years, or die tonight. All I can do is keep me well, so I don't get sick too.

This is so hard on all of us - so take care of you. Figure out what you can control and what you can't and do it.  It's tough, for sure but with the lack of knowledge around all aspects of the disease, it's the only way we can be sure it doesn't take us down as well as our loved ones.
