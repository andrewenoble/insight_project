"My mom was officially diagnosed with frontaltemporal dementia in 2010. The doctor said she could live 2 months or 10 years. She's alive, but she's not alive, she's existing. She's 59 now. It started in her mid 40s, we just didn't know what was happening. She thought she was fine, people who are slowly losing their minds don't always realize it. 

My dad is her full time caretaker. My sister lives at home and works and also helps my dad take care of her. I couldn't do it. I moved home briefly for a little over a year and had to move out because my own mental health was suffering. My heart breaks every time I go home to see my parents. If I think too much about it I end up crying. I cried a lot when I first heard the diagnosis. Less now, but I still do. Watching a loved one who was once a strong independent person deteriorate before your eyes is a fate I would never wish on anyone.

"My family has one of the ""rare"" forms of bvFDT and its devastating. I was just running the figures after one family member joked it was easy to send Christmas cards because everyone was in jail and came up with a rough incarceration rate of 15.8% (mostly for really dumb impulsive crap like embezzling, shoplifiting) as compared to the national incarceration rate of 2.8%. The best thing you can do for your kids is find a study and get in it, that is the only hope we have. An unfortunate fact of this disease is that your father could become impossible to live with, even violent. He may not be safe around your children after a time. My grandfather suddenly turned around and broke my jaw when I was five, for example. Kids shrill voices can be annoying. Medication can help, but you need someone who is familiar with the disease to get the mix right and not make things worse. This type of dementia presents unique demands.

My dad died nearly two years ago. We had a hard time with mum. Socials services etc. basically tried to force us to look after mum, in the end we had to walk away. She was left in her house on her own with a number of social workers, two police and two psychiatrists. She was sectioned and detained - at first the police wouldn't remove her - didn't want to be seen removing an elderly lady from her house - then mum voluntarily left... and has been in a home ever since.

It's hard seeing her in a place like that. It brings home what getting old can really mean.

Just before dad died, he kept collapsing. I was with him the last time... he had a full blown seizure. Previously, it was mum who could never give a good description of what happened. We're pretty sure mum piled on the pressure and he tried to deal with it.

My brother was called out the night dad died, so he was there trying to give dad CPR when the ambulance turned up... and said he'd gone.

It's early days (we only got the diagnosis a couple of months ago) and my dad has got better at opening up, it seems to be easier for him since the diagnosis, as it's out in the open - friends know now etc whereas before they just suspected something but no one talked about it.

I have tried pointing my dad in the direction of online forums where there's an active community of carers, he's on the internet a lot so even if he just browses and reads the advice on there it's a good start.

I also forward on any practical advice I'm given (this is a good one about knowing how to talk to people with alzheimers, with examples: http://forum.alzheimers.org.uk/showthread.php?30801-Compassionate-Communication-with-the-Memory-Impaired), then using that as a talking point when I see him. 

Also I've encouraged him to talk to his friends about it, and also spoken to my parent's friends to encourage them to get in touch and be a support to him.

Basically, play it by ear. I remember feeling very anxious before the diagnosis, and relieved and able to talk more once we'd got the ""this is what it is"" done. Good luck.

I am very saddened that no one really can be bothered with him.  We live in 2 different countries.  All I wish to bring him over here so that I can take care of him.  He is so young.  He is on high dose of medication and when I got to see the peep of his video, I knew from his facial features that he is heavily sedated and he won't last long.  Now they have cut the dosage to whatever level should be given to him.  There are other ways (holistic approach) etc.  to care for his conditions, not totally rely on medication.  After his medication was reduced in intake, he started to talk now and god knows what else is going on there as I cannot see from here.  He is my brother but I do care for him.  By the way, he will be celebrating xmas by himself while the wife, 2 kids, parents and their brother, sister-in law with their kids are off to India for a holiday.  If someone gave me 50 million or money started to fall from the sky, I wouldn't go if I was his next of kin and attorney.

"She has owned more and more cats as the years have gone by. We had a couple when I was a kid and now she is up to between 6 and 10 at a time.

When I was younger our house was clean. When I arrived here a few months ago it was terrible, the smell was terrible, and if you walked into the kitchen at night and turned the light on you'd have seen literally hundreds of roaches feeding on the cat food she had spread across the counter tops.

There is something wrong, but I'm not getting any help from her in wanting to help her. There is more at work here than simple dementia/Alzheimers. She has turned into an animal hoarder along with keeping junk laying around that serves no purpose but to compound the mess and provide yet another habitat for the zoonotic vector.

How can I get help in here to have her diagnosed? Her doctor is making a killing off of her and the guy absolutely hates me. I had seen him a few months ago about feeling like shit all the time and told him that I had been treated in the past with a variety of tricyclic antidepressants and had very bad reactions to them. He blew me off, prescribing me Prozac of all things (I am prone to bouts of rage as it is). 

At one point the son of a bitch had her on Amitryptaline and hydrocodone - she is an Irrritable Bowel Syndrome patient with Celiac disease, along with a long history of ulcerative colitis and abdominal surgery. The two medications caused, or at least contributed to, a paralytic ileus that landed her in the hospital under a knife after a week of no bowel movements. Patients with a history like hers, especially of abdominal surgeries and abnormalities, should be given far more consideration for the complications that could arise from prescribing them medications explicitly known for interfering or shutting down peristolysis and causing constipation.

So I'm not getting any help from him, and I cant get her to see anyone else.

"I am sorry that you are going through this. There's nothing really positive about a family member suffering from dementia. My step father was diagnosed with Early-Onset Alzheimer's about 5 years ago, and he is only 62. My grandmother as well has Alzheimer's although she is in her 80s and has progressed to the point where she is no longer verbal.

I won't lie. It's not easy. It's like a very drawn-out version of losing a loved one. I guess just try to be loving and supportive where and when you can, with the understanding that eventually she will probably no longer know what her condition is, or who you are.

My grandmother still shows a glimmer of appreciation when we visit her and hold her hand etc. But I don't think she knows any of her family anymore. And my step father still usually remembers our names (even my kids), although he has trouble knowing what's going on day-to-day and will repeat the same conversation 10+ times per day.

So I guess my meager advice is to make the best of the time you have left, but understand that it will continue to get progressively more difficult.",,,,4a4a,,,1447258725,t5_2rfqf,t3_3serdj,t3_3serdj,2,1449738458,0,0,cwwm8hu,dementia,2,,

In any event,  keep in mind that testing for dementia involves numerous tests done to suss out inconsistencies in memory and language use.   This is in addition to blood work, the CAT scan, etc.  

Anyone who tries to diagnosis simply by sitting and talking with your Dad doesn't know what he/she is doing.

"Never allow yourself to think you are being selfish or lazy. You are doing your best to watch over your parents. This is a VERY mentally taxing situation to go through. The fact that you go see her every once in a while is you doing much more than others would do with their own parents.

For your sake though, do what you can when you can. My grandmother has dementia and we had no idea for a couple of years. My parents moved her into their home from out of state and that is when we all saw that things were not sticking and she was time-jumping. I saw my happy parents decline from laughing with to yelling at grandma. No one teaches or shows you how to handle an ailing relative. My parents' goal was to never put grandma in a home but for their own safety and mental health they had to. Grandma was becoming combative and tried to hit my mother with a frying pan. She would also disrespect my father in various ways including undressing and telling him he didnt live in his own house and that he couldn't tell her what to do in the house. It is because of my mom and dad that grandma was even being cared for. My mom is the only sibling out of 6 of them that made they effort to care for their mom. When your own blood doesn't bust a move to help or send money for care it is all on your shoulders you have an even heavier weight to drag. Thank God your brother is active too in the care of your parents. The sibling support in all this in invaluable. Just by you making an effort to call or visit your mom speaks volumes and don't let anyone else tell you different. Being able to talk to your sibling and they know exactly what you are taking about helps in dealing with all of this.

Anyway, you have to take care of you. Your mom is in good hands. Let them handle what they are trained to do. Yes, it is difficult to see her this way but whenever you see her don't look at what the disease has done to her. Think about the good memories you have had with her and enjoy the moments of being in her presence. She is still physically here. Even if she forget everything, use these opportunities to speak love to her. Answer her questions again and again but keep saying your ""I love you's"" and give her your hugs. When you leave the facility or hang up the phone tell yourself you are doing your best and your best is good. Then get ice cream or do something good for yourself because you may need to refuel yourself with energy, praise or just a peaceful setting/situation.

"Never thought of the Modafinil to help with cognition. I'll run it by my mother who is a nurse and one of his caregivers (including me) to see if he can take it. He might not due to the diabetes and blood pressure medication he takes. 

The caffeine is right out, he can't handle that much caffeine since RLS runs in the family, any stimulants that are adenosine and/or nicotinic acetylcholine antagonists just makes it worse so none of those would work for him. 

He even has issues with taking diphenhydramine or doxylamine because it exacerbates it. Same with me, since I have RLS pretty bad, too. 

They do have him on opioids and benzos but we try to restrict the intake of those due to their tendency to cause really bad dependence issues if he were to take too many. We keep the narcotics locked in a safe and administer to him as needed. Like I said, I'll run the Modafinil by my mother to see if it's worthwhile.

Moreover, I came across this the other day as I am participating in a campaign which aims to make people suffering, or know people who are suffering with dementia have 'easier lives' somewhat. People with dementia often need to feel comfortable and independent which is a key factor when monitoring the health of a patient with dementia.

"sorry to hear about your situation, it's a tough one. i was sort of in a similar situation with my grandma who now, is in the final stage of dementia. she would do the same thing at the doctors, hid it pretty well for a little while. the main thing was she didn't want to look stupid because she didn't know the date so she would sarcastically say ""oh i don't know"" and force a fake laugh. there's really not much the doctor can do unfortunately until it progresses and really shows. my grandma finally came to terms when she couldn't remember what she hit with her car. i still don't know to this day what she hit. 
as for your grandpa, i send my grandma to an elder daycare center, you could try looking into that. the one i sent my grandma is pretty good. it's mostly a place for dementia/alzheimers patients but a good amount of just bored older folk like to hang out there also. it could be a nice change up if your grandparents are willing to try it out.

One thing we've seen with this is that the patient himself either won't remember certain issues/episodes, or won't admit it. And if/when they remember things that happened, the timeline is often way out of line. So it's important that someone accompanies him to doctors appointments.

"Try to break things down in bit size portions (so to speak) as to not get so overwhelmed. Take it one day at a time.

General Practitioners are not as well trained to know which kind of antidepressant to prescribe as a Psychologist. Go see a Psychologist for yourself.

Call Adult Protective Services and tell them the situation you are having with your mother. Basically the same thing you just told me. Tell them she will not see another doctor and the doctor she is seeing does not seem (in your opinion) to be treating her appropriately. Ask them to contact a social worker and have this person come to your moms home to talk with your her and also assess her living situation. Unless you mom has someone else that will take care of her, more than likely the social workers will help you have your mom taken (probably with your mom kicking and screaming) to a facility for evaluation. Then they will be able to advise you on what to do next. 

It is not uncommon for an elderly person, that is unable to take care of themselves anymore, to resist being put in a memory care facility. But for their safety and well being this usually is what needs to be done. Happens all the time. 

One more thing, if this is what you end up having to do for your mom, expect her to be angry with you for a while. Don't let her anger stop you from making sure she is taken care of. THE MOST IMPORTANT thing is that you mother is in a safe environment where she can be monitored 24/7. ",,,,KBH1220,,,1448837380,t5_2rfqf,t3_3uoqn8,t1_cxh6tzv,1,1450107927,0,0,cxh89rw,dementia,1,,

The father in law outlived the doctor. I went and got a CNA license to help with everything. My rotation in a care home was really really eye opening. 

Taking her in is HARD work and restricts your life in some ways. But I am glad I did it. It takes two, a person by themselves can be overwhelming. Take time for yourselves, get respite care. Don't take things she might say or do personally. Learn the art of distraction and be willing to answer the same question 10 times in an hour. 

And get everyone off the sugar and processed food. Sugar is linked with dementia. My husband now has it, may be a genetic link, but I got him off all sugar and most processed food and he is better! The current doctor says that is impossible. ",,,,corbie,,,1447003303,t5_2rfqf,t3_3oxer7,t3_3oxer7,1,1449675991,0,0,cwt015q,dementia,1,,
