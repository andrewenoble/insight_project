"Yes I agree with playing music from her youth. Dementia and Alzheimer's is in effect the stripping away of the more short term memories. My grandmother has dementia also. The brain works backwards in effect and causes her to eventually forget the more recent things and remember her earlier memories as a child and young adult. We played my grandmother music from her youth and she was dancing in her chair, clapping along and knew a lot of the words. The earliest memories will be the last to go in this disease and so things from this time are more likely to spark her interest or cause her to remember things and find enjoyment and pleasure.

"My mother died of Alzheimer's, so I speak here from personal experience.

Maybe it would help if you can help your brothers and other family members realize that she remembers some things (people) and not others because of how and where the brain has been damaged.

It's got absolutely zero to do with who she cared about, how much she loved.

It's 100% to do with the mechanics of which parts of her brain have been damaged, which have not.

If everyone can take that to heart, there's no awkwardness when she remembers one of you and not the other.

Also, on things like her husband -

The concept of lying has no place in this situation.  We tell people the truth out of respect, because it would be condescending or manipulative to misrepresent the truth to a person who's fully capable of comprehending and dealing with the truth.

But she's no longer capable of those things.  Just as there would be no sense in saying ""Look at that sunset!"" to a blind man, there's no sense in ""telling the truth"" to a person who can't remember it.

If she cries when you remind her (with context) of who you are, make a big deal over how ""everyone forgets things, don't worry about it, come on Grandma, did you think you'd hurt my feelings ?!  We know you love us!!""

And no matter what, she's not a stranger - She's a wonderful person who gave life and countless memories to you and your brothers - Your gift to her now, that shows your love and appreciation better than anything, is to do whatever it takes to make your visits happy times for her.",false,true,t1_cdbw8g3,calicoan,,0,1384195363,t5_2r8fp,t3_1qd8fk,t3_1qd8fk,1,1428702220,0,0,cdbw8g3,Alzheimers,1,,

"Hi. I'm sorry to hear about your father, but I think you're right on the money with this one. My mother hasn't been officially diagnosed, but it's in the cards. It's something that has been in our family and she's definitely showing signs and has been for a while. 

One of those signs is the inability to sleep. She is up all hours of the night and sleeps all day. So her interactions during the day with normal people, if she's awake, tend to be confused and drawn out. No theme whatsoever. Nights are not better as she tends to fall and hurt herself while doing god knows what. 

We've recently had a few meds changed around per doctors orders and she's been catching up on sleep lately. It hasn't been perfect, there are still lots of issues we need to address once we get her into a neurologist. But just by virtue of being awake during the day she has been able to go outside, breathe fresh air, interact more and hopefully progress. This is all anecdotal of course, but I encourage you to look up the scientific research and feel free to post it here.

"When my grandmother was in the middle stages of the disease, she developed an extreme case of Sundowner's Syndrome. She would be fairly normal during the day, but as soon as night fell she would get angry... Cussing, fighting, screaming; acting in a way no one had ever seen her act before. You mentioned the phrase ""last night"", so I'm wondering if your husband'a grandmother deals with the same symptom. 

It is a very scary experience to be around someone in that frame of mind. 

Quick edit, because you asked how did we deal with it? To answer your question, the grandchildren called her (and visited) only during the day, the adults supported my grandfather at night, and as her personality slowly faded away, we grieved and spent time looking through photos with her.

"My mother had it.  My uncle has it.

My sister kept my mom till the end, but my uncle is in a nursing home.  My cousin says the home where my uncle is is staffed ""by people who like their jobs"", and that it's a good place.

There does come a time, given you can find a good home, like where my uncle is, when it won't matter to your mom where she is, when she doesn't know you, or have any thoughts about wanting to be independent or hold on to her life.  As painful as that is for you to contemplate, there is a good side to it, as *she* will no longer be suffering.  I thoroughly admire and respect that you're determined to care for her now, but I hope you'll be able to consider a home when that time comes.

On a more practical note, for right now - My mom got put on an anti-depressant early on, as undiagnosed depression can lead to the kinds of memory problems she had in the early stages, and her dr. wanted to be sure all other avenues had been tried out.  Eventually my sister and I agreed to take her off, since by then it was completely clear that she did indeed have alzheimer's.  We ended up putting her back on the anti-depressant - Her mood was much less happy without it, so it definitely improved her quality of life.

So, if you haven't already, talk to her dr. about medication options for her depression, fear, frustration.

As for your siblings, ideally you'd like them to join with you in figuring out how to make this work, but from what you say, they won't get on the bandwagon to that extent.  Maybe, though, you could get *some* help from them if you ramp down your view of their involvement - From time to time, ask one or another of them for a specific thing.  Instead of ""What are we going to do about Mom?"", something like ""Can you come over for a couple of hours next friday, so I can go to a Dr. appt?""  Not sure from what you say if that's a possibility, but maybe it's an approach you hadn't thought of trying yet.

Lastly, on a somewhat radical note - You might want to investigate a ketogenic diet (Google search - [ketogenic diet alzheimer's](https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=ketogenic+diet+alzheimer%27s&amp;oq=ketogenic+diet+alzheimer%27s&amp;gs_l=hp.3..0.1116.9381.0.9725.28.21.0.6.6.1.1393.17726.6-8j9.17.0...0.0...1c.1.12.psy-ab.acOAfc7wI_8&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.45960087,d.cGE&amp;fp=a3f91beb4226fb3d&amp;biw=1173&amp;bih=632))

I try to keep myself on this diet because I have aches and pains, and cutting out carbs in this manner makes a HUGE difference.

You can also find some people over on /r/BipolarReddit who attest to the help they get with mood stabilization from a ketogenic diet.
