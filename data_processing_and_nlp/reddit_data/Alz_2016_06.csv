"Relevant text from [Salk News](http://www.salk.edu/news-release/cannabinoids-remove-plaque-forming-alzheimers-proteins-from-brain-cells/):

&gt; The researchers found that high levels of amyloid beta were associated with cellular inflammation and higher rates of neuron death. They demonstrated that exposing the cells to THC reduced amyloid beta protein levels and eliminated the inflammatory response from the nerve cells caused by the protein, thereby allowing the nerve cells to survive.

&gt;“Inflammation within the brain is a major component of the damage associated with Alzheimer’s disease, but it has always been assumed that this response was coming from immune-like cells in the brain, not the nerve cells themselves,” says Antonio Currais, a postdoctoral researcher in Schubert’s laboratory and first author of the paper. “When we were able to identify the molecular basis of the inflammatory response to amyloid beta, it became clear that THC-like compounds that the nerve cells make themselves may be involved in protecting the cells from dying.”",,,,missthinks,,,1467298056,t5_2r8fp,t3_4qm1n4,t3_4qm1n4,3,1469398826,0,0,d4u087s,Alzheimers,3,,

"My father-in-law has a rare form of Parkinson's. It is like the worst of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's together. He shakes uncontrollably, lost his ability to speak clearly, pees in the bed, can't walk unassisted, wakes up at least 5 times throughout the night, forgets who we are, makes up stories about how we steal from him, yells/screams in public, grabs womens breasts uncontrollably in public, he can't feed himself, drink a cup of water himself, he can't even change the channel on the TV himself. 

We take care of him full-time and he lives in our home. We are dealing with the same guilt of needing to put him in a home and it is killing us. 

My husband doesn't want to let go, but he also knows in his heart that that mean old man bossing him around and yelling at him everyday is not his father. He also knows that there is nothing else he could do to improve his quality of life. He's done all that he can do. Now he must resign. 

A Doctor once told us that when the time comes, we should take it with a big sigh of relief and a pat on the back because being a full-time caregiver is one of the most difficult positions one can ever find themselves in. He also said that it is better for the patient to wake up confused in a nursing home, than to wake up confused at their caregiver's home because at least they will understand that something is wrong when they see Doctors and Nurses walking around. They can recognize that, if not the people closest to them. 

Best of luck to you. Grieve the loss of your mother, but look happily to the future knowing tha tyou have just gotten a big piece of your life back. Also keep in mind that if your mother were in her right mind, she would not want you to put your life on hold to take care of her, especially if she wasn't mentally around to enjoy you.

"Can't speak for anyone but myself and my mom, but I have yet to find a way to break these spirals.  They have to work their way out.  For mom it was diaharrhea.  She always had it and wanted something to make it stop.  Always.  Forever.  Every visit.  One sister gave her something off the counter to help her solidify her BMs but then she's complaining of stomach aches and so on.  I took her to the specialist and he said she had an impacted bowel and hadn't had diarrhea in years.  So all we could do was listen to her complaints and let it go.  (and put her on meds for her impacted bowel.) Now she rarely talks about it (2 years later) and this has been a change for about 6 months.  She still complains that people are 'stealing her stuff' but not as often.  She still talks about being exhausted from having to work so hard knitting things for the poor, but she hasn't had her knitting needles in months. (We had to take them away after she stabbed a fellow resident.)

so what did I learn? Just because mom says something, repeatedly, doesn't mean it is true.  It can mean her brain is repeatedly firing a neural network that is working and she doesn't realize she can or should shut it off.

"I wanted to let you know I understand, and my heart goes out to you. My grandmother passed away last October after having Alzheimer's for 10 years. I also live far away from my family, and I found it really hard to even visit my Gram without breaking down. Just remember her as she was and the good times you two shared together. Try not to take it personal when she stops remembering you. I found it helpful to put myself in her shoes from her perspective (confused, in pain and can't verbalized it) and it helped me be less frustrated when she would be difficult.
As for your grandfather may I suggest setting up a weekly phone call, just to check in with him and let him know your thinking of him and the struggle that he is having.

"This is a great comment and link.  There are questions about the form of antioxidants (which included alpha lipoic acid) used in a well-publicized Alzheimer's trial.  This trial is unfortunately often cited as proof that antioxidants cannot be used to treat Alzheimer's disease.

Depletion of glutathione is a critical factor in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease.

http://atlasofscience.org/glutathione-a-molecular-whistleblower-for-alzheimers-disease/

The partial obstacle to  cysteine supplementation to increase glutathione levels in Alzheimer's disease is that peroxynitrite inhibits cysteine transport.

"When a man has been happily married and loses his wife, it's normal for him to want to be married again. It's a tribute to your mom that he's seeking out that kind of companionship again. At his age, it's not about romance, it's about mutual support. He needs to be with someone.

I speak from experience, as the younger woman. When my husband's first wife died after many months as a terminal cancer patient, he of course was devastated by the loss, but what he felt most was relief, relief that it was over. What others have said is true: he had already done his grieving.

He wanted to move on with his life, and at his age — he was 67 at the time — you don't dilly-dally about finding a new mate. Your own mortality is staring you in the face, and you don't want to spend the rest of your days alone or dependent on your children.

So, as it happens, eight weeks after his wife's death we began dating. I had known both of them for years and we had many mutual friends, so we were comfortable together. After another few weeks, he asked me to marry him.

His friends were delighted with the idea, and I could see that we could make a good life together. My only concern was that his daughter would be hurt, so I told him we needed her approval first.

He had a heart-to-heart with her, and she said that while it was rather soon, she was happy that he'd have someone to love and take care of, and that someone would love and take care of him.

That was almost 30 years ago. We had a wonderful life together, and I grew close to his daughter and grandchildren. He died last year — yes, well into his 90s — but starting over kept him young and looking to the future.

You and your sisters have just lost your mother, so it's understandable that another woman coming into the picture would seem to be taking the love that your father should be giving to his family. But your dad is just trying to find happiness again. Don't make it difficult for him.

"Alzheimer's researcher here:

I just want to point out that Alz is not trending towards younger diagnoses at this point to the best of my knowledge. If you have a source on that statement, I'd love to see it.

The # of cases will triple by 2050 because the population is aging, which means that there will be more people over the age of 65 by then than there are now. It has nothing to do with people getting Alz earlier in life. Early onset Alz is most commonly due to genetics and is thus heritable, while late onset is sporadic and age is the greatest risk factor.

If you're going to come into this sub to spread information, thats wonderful, but please back it up with reputable sources as much as possible.

I don't say this to belittle their pain and suffering or love, just to point out that everyone handles death and loss in a different way. This disease hurts, and not just the diseased. He may be escaping his pain by sharing love. He may just need to feel happiness after years of darkness. If my SO's role and mine were reversed, I can say I would be comforted if I knew he found love and happiness again. 
   Having said all of this your sisters are grieving as well. They may not be able to accept this.  If that is the case no amount of arguing, logic, or emphasis ones pleas will change the way they feel. It's possible just time and space will help.

If you treat them just as stories and apply no pressure to your father to remember (or even want to hear them) I feel it could be comforting for him to hear of things that could give him a safe feeling of home.

"Very interesting study. The full research article is linked below.

http://www.nature.com/articles/npjamd201612

It is important to realize that this study was done entirely in a petri dish, using human brain cancer cells from a tumor. These results will hopefully translate into future animal and human studies, but it is still way too early to know.

Most of this paper focused on inflammation in neurons that are artificially forced to produce amyloid beta, the neurotoxin present in Alzheimer's. Interestingly, they conclude the cannabinoid PGD2 is neuroprotective, where previous other studies have concluded the opposite results. This is something they fail to acknowledge or explain in their discussion. They claim that the cannabinoid THC is the most neuroprotective of the cannabinoids, which is an exciting finding, even in an artificial system. Finally, the most exciting result is the demonstration that blocking the RAGE protein is neuroprotective. Currently, there is a large human clinical trial recruiting to determine if anti-RAGE drugs will slow Alzheimer's progression. This paper supports this hypothesis, and we will see the results in the next few years.

"Highly recommend he sees a geriatric psych who specializes in dementia. They are much more familiar with the intricacies of meds &amp; dosing than a run of the mill family doc (or even neurologist) is. 

Aggression is a big issue for us too. It used to be constant- screaming, crying, ""get out of my house,"" nastiness. Now it's less frequent. There are still occasional spikes, but overall the days are much easier. It took a few months to get a routine settled, and some fiddling with the dosages. 

In my humble opinion, Valium isn't going to cut it. All that does is cause sleepiness, which can actually make confusion and aggression worse. That and Xanax were what was prescribed by the neurologist. YMMV. Geriatric psych has her on risperidone 0.5 in the afternoon, and 0.25 at bedtime, along with a mild sleeping pill at bedtime. Risperidone is an anti psychotic and shouldn't be prescribed like its candy, but this is a serious and potentially dangerous situation- the aggression warrants it.

Nope, Grandma found a third “just in case” set, and off she went into town while grandpa was sleeping one afternoon, she did pretty well getting around and home however, she bought enough food at the grocery store to feed her “young growing family of 6.” When mom took away all the keys Grandma called a locksmith, and away she went again. Then we all decided that okay car has to go! Off car went and to this day Grandma complains that she cannot believe someone stole their car, the police have been filled in. Anyway Grandma needed milk or dog food or birdseed the three things that she gets very upset over being short on. So she fired up the tractor and drove into town. Okay tractor gets put out of commission. THEN she ended up taking the riding lawn mower into town a few months after that. She’s also tried to borrow many of the neighbours’ vehicles over the last few years. 

It’s a funny story to look back on now, but seriously get rid of the car and all the vehicles she will have any access to. Once in a multigenerational home, maybe decoy keys? That will get her in the car but cant turn the car over, so she will think the car is broken?

"1) [Parkinson's](http://fastonlinemeds.com/alzheimer-s-and-parkinson-s-medicine-usa.html) disease patients with dementia (PDD) have a much higher rate of major depression than do people with Alzheimer's disease. Please note: Dementia is a symptom of deterioration of intellectual abilities - AD is one disease which causes dementia 

2) Patients with [Alzheimer's](http://fastonlinemeds.com/alzheimer-s-and-parkinson-s-medicine-usa.html) disease showed more severe anosognosia and disinhibition than patients with Parkinson's disease 

3) Differentiation in both motor and non-motor issues: 
PD: rest tremor, dopamine responsive, bradyphrenia, visual-spatial deficits, dating capacity, recency discrimination, sequencing and set-shifting (the last few are cognitive issues) 
AD: myoclonus, orofacial dyskinesia, aphasia and progressive global dementia 

4) Hallucinations were more severe in PD patients, while aberrant motor behavior, agitation, disinhibition, irritability, euphoria, and apathy were more severe in AD 

5) The projected life span of a person with AD is shorter than a person with PD. 

6) Early onset AD does occur but is less common than YOPD 

7) The cause(s) of each condition appears to be different. 
An area of similarity is that there is no definitive explanation of the causes of either PD nor AD although both seem to have protein misfolding as a causative factor along with oxidative stress. 

8) Alzheimer's disease is characterized by loss of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions while PD is caused by a loss of neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the basal ganglia. 

9) There seems to be a higher genetic risk factor in Parkinson's than in Alzheimer's. 

10) The clinical hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease are progressive impairment in memory, judgment, decision making, orientation to physical surroundings, and language. 
Although both motor and non-motor symptoms including psychosocial symptoms and their onset vary significantly, the primary symptoms of Parkinson's disease are still motor symptoms. 
Tremor, Rigidity, Akinsia (Bradykinesia) and Postural Instability. 

There is significant overlap of symptoms. As AD first manifests it is often confused with the aging process. PD is similar to an accelerated aging process.

1.Memory loss that disrupts daily life
2.Challenges in planning or solving problems
3.Difficulty completing familiar tasks at home, at work or at leisure
4.Confusion with time or place
5.Trouble understanding visual images and spatial relationships
6.New problems with words in speaking or writing
7.Misplacing things and losing the ability to retrace steps
8.Decreased or poor judgment
9.Withdrawal from work or social activities
10.Changes in mood and personality

I'd try to console her, but not being able to drive was a big deal to my mom - I think it made her feel trapped, and I'm sure she was already frightened and confused by her condition. 
I don't think there is a good way to handle this - meaning that she is probably going to resent the crap out of whoever finally doesn't let her drive, but if she really isn't capable - tell your Dr. so he can revoke the license. Make him the bad guy - because you can always be on her side afterwards, ""I know mom, I can't believe it - but he is a doctor, and he's done good for us this whole time, and I trust him, etc etc"".",,,,technicalrogue,,,1466010517,t5_2r8fp,t3_4o7enb,t1_d4a95bj,2,1469060236,0,0,d4aegje,Alzheimers,2,,

"First of all I'm happy to find this Alzheimer's reddit.  In the same boat and have been dealing with my Mom driving thousands and thousands of miles back and forth to help her.  This week she bent over in the yard and poked her eye with a small branch/tree in the yard and got a corneal abrasion.

I can tell you it only gets worse as far as them being able to take care of themselves.  There are so many cans of worms possible.  She is lucky to have him to help take care of her.  My Mom is living alone with Alzheimers and I'm trying everything I can to get her in assisted living.  I would start looking into assisted living and see if that is a possibility.  From what I understand they thrive and do much better simply because of the fact of having regular meals and activities.  Unless there are more people that can help in the family.  Friends, church or anything can be helpful.  Friends were able to help my Mom to a point but now I think she is annoying everyone to death and getting angry with neighbors.

Alzheimer's really sucks.  Honestly I think it is hardest on caregivers and victims are more oblivious to what is going on.",,,,manateemedia,,,1465851087,t5_2r8fp,t3_4niv0w,t3_4niv0w,1,1469015691,0,0,d47tln4,Alzheimers,1,,

"My grandmother has Alzheimer's. She is 68. I lived with her for years and then went to college and got busy with stupid bullshit adulting stuff. I didn't go see her enough til she got bad. It breaks my heart to talk to her in person. She doesn't know how to use a phone anymore. Or walk. We're terrified of her being kicked out of her memory care home. I think she knows what's going on. Relish that your mother was there for you for so long. Love is not only a memory, but it lives forever. Cherish the love with her you've had and never forget her. You'll find ways to bring her into conversation on a day to day basis. Love the love you both had together and be happy for who she was and what she is now. Her love and energy will always be there with you. Be the wonderful person she wants you to be and live life happily. You'll make her proud. I'm very sorry for your loss.

Not sure whether they used the (R)-enantiomer (R-ALA, the biologically active form) or a racemic mix of ALA. I would recommend R-ALA over the racemic version as it is speculated the S-enantiomer (left-handed version) may block the R version.

Anecdotally I cannot tolerate the racemic version for more than a few days due to side effects of falling asleep (hypoglycemia?) and pyrosis (heartburn). R-ALA does not have these side affects but did make me feel pretty miserable for the first week I took it, although I was taking a much higher dosage.

N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) should also be beneficial since it ramps up endogenous production of glutathione.

"This is an excellent point. 

He was in the trenches every day - this was his life - and we waited until the last minute to put mom in a home - and after we did - the staff didn't know what to make of him being there, literally, all the time. 

He took such great care of her, he loved her more than anything - so I guess my sisters are having a hard time processing how he could have affection for another so soon. 

It is hard for them to understand that while he did love her, right up to that last breath, that he said goodbye to his wife before that - 

This makes me remember, he once said, ""That's not Mom, that's the disease - this is what we are dealing with now - a disease"".
