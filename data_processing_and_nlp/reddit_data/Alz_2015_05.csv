Is your mom still driving? One thing I didn't know is that if a person is diagnosed with cognitive impairment, at least in California, the doctor is required to file a report with the Department of Motor Vehicles. In our case, the DMV required my husband to report to a special testing center to evaluate his driving ability.

Also, before you have your appointment, you should talk to your family lawyer about powers of attorney and such. Once a person is diagnosed with cognitive impairment, their legal status may change.

Your mom will be at the doctor's for only a brief time. From my experience, the effects of the disease seem to come and go. So your mom could be especially out-of-it at the doctor's office or especially alert. Therefore the initial diagnosis might not tally with what you think. It will take repeated visits for the neurologist to really assess your mom's abilities. So listen to the doctor, but understand that you and your dad probably know best what your mom can and can't do.

"Hello,
  First let me say you are not alone.  My SO has AD and I know your frustration, pain and concern. The lesson that has been hardest for me to learn in all of this is that in order to take care of someone with AD you must first learn to take care of yourself.  It seems impossible to do this, how can you juggle all of your Moms problems and still take care of yours?  You don't, you handle yours first.  It seems wrong, it seems selfish.  If you care for yourself first, you will be able to more effectively care for her.  
If you have the funds, call around to assisted living centers and see if they have day respite.  Think of this as adult day care.  It doesn't fix the problems, but it allows you a bit of time to work on you and grocery shop and go to the Dr. for you.  While you are at it consider looking to see if assisted living is affordable for your mother.  Its generally nicer than a nursing home, but expensive.  If you can visit often it helps balance out your needs and hers.  
Contact your local Alzheimer's Association.  They may have respite groups and even though it sounds stupid, they have support groups...they can help.  
Another lesson I haven't quite handled on my own....She doesn't have to be correct, just happy.  I.E. She says its Tuesday and its Sunday, just let it go , correcting her just upsets her and annoys you.
We all snap at some point, I find if I take care of myself and allow myself to be somewhat selfish, I snap less.  
I have found my SO's taste buds seem to change almost daily, I know your pain.  He doesn't always want water but I got a bunch of the flavorings and give each glass a squirt and call it a fruit drink.  He's happy and so am I.  
I also think you should check with her Dr. he may suggest lorazepam or similar to calm her when she is agitated.  I find these to be a double edged sword as it also adds to confusion, which can lead to more agitation.  It has its place though.  

If funds are tight start out by finding a friend, family member, neighbor, coworker, church goer to sit with mom one day.  Ask for a commitment of 3 hours.  They can tell stories, watch a nature documentary, bake cookies together or just sit in the next room and let your mom rest too.  Try to find several different people so you don't wear them out.  If you are lucky you can get 4 together and get one afternoon per week ""off"".  Its only one day a month for your volunteers so its not asking a lot.  Leave the house during this time.  This is your time!   

Also find out if your mother can get any assistance if money is a problem.  www.benefitscheckup.org is from the council on aging.  If she or her husband were active in military during war she may be eligible for VA benefits.  ebenefits.va.gov can help.  Apply for housing and food programs as well, they can free up funds for caregiving.  If she is on Medicare and unstable or has had falls, she may be eligible for a bit of homecare PT or similar. Sorry to rant, and you may have known all of this or tried all of these, just hoping there is a small bit of info in all of this to help.

"Bay Shore/Shirley, NY – Today was a very special day - 11 year old Krista Cusimano watched her dream, to create awareness and raise funds in memory of her grandfather “Pa,” who succumbed to Alzheimer's Disease at the age of 66, become a reality.

"Tanzi is a brilliant man as are his amyloidist/tauist colleagues but they have made some fundamental mistakes.  One is to assume that parital correlation is causation.  Both amyloid (either oligomers or plaques) and neurofibrillary tau tangles are the product of intracellular calcium release (which activates calpains).  But in the absence of widespread oxidative damage to the brain, neither do much damage to the brain.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20961659

An enzyme called phospholipase C not only leads to amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles via intracellular calcium release it also leads by another pathway (protein kinase C and p38 MAPK) to the real cause of Alzheimer's disease: peroxynitrites.  As long as peroxynitrites are scavenged, a person can have both amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles in their brain but not Alzheimer's disease.  Once the brain's master peroxynitrites scavenger--glutathione--is exhausted that is when Alzheimer's disease begins.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8940610

Peroxynitrites inhibit the release and synthesis of neurotransmitters involved in short-term memory, sleep, mood, social recognition, and alertness, reduce blood flow in the brain and the transport of glucose which can cause apathy, wandering, and delusions, nitrate tau proteins which impedes neurotransmissions and the transport of nutrients in the brain, over-activate NMDA receptors which can result in their deactivation and subsequent hallucinations, prevent the regeneration of neurons in the hippocampus, and deplete energy in the brain resulting in mitochondrial failure and the death of neurons.

The key to treating Alzheimer's disease is not in removing amyloid or tau.  It lays in scavenging and reversing part of the damage done by peroxynitrites.  Here are two clinical trials in which peroxynitrite scavengers have partially reversed Alzheimer's disease: eugenol in rosemary essential oil via aromatherapy and ferulic acid, syringic acid, vanillin, p-coumaric acid, and maltol.
