My father sometimes pees in the potted plants near the bathroom. He has ocasionally peed in the shower at night. What we did is first up put a sign with big lettering saying toilet on it. He is able to find the toilet better now because of it. We also often guide him to the toilet cause his problem is more forgetting where it is. Try your best to calmy remind them to only use the toilet. Its quite hard to teach them new things but for some reason they don't forget this new bad behaviour.  Best of luck.,,,,ludunz,,,1444121632,t5_2rfqf,t3_3nntsf,t3_3nntsf,3,1446799998,0,0,cvpwpmu,dementia,3,,

"I don't know if this will help. My husband has dementia and it was sliding. His father had it very very bad before he died. My father in law had diabetes and was a total sugar junkie. My husband had slid into eating a lot of sugar.

He is getting better. The doctor says that is impossible. But it is working. He is remembering things now when his short term had gone to less than 10 minutes. He now talks about and remembers what happened yesterday and beyond. His moods are normal now too. No more of the dementia anger.

"Perhaps I can help you a little.

For starters, there are indications that some rare forms of dementias are hereditary like Huntington's Disease. Most people who suffer from Frontotemporal Dementia are ""non-familial"" which means they developed the disease without a hereditary factor. It is very unlikely you will pass this on to your kids even if you do develop it.

Aging seems to be the primary factor in determining one's risk in developing dementia. At the age of 90, 1 in 4 people will have dementia in some form. The odds of developing the disease doubles every 5 years starting from around the age of 70. You can mitigate your risk by remaining mentally active, such as by reading, doing puzzles, and participating in structured learning.

Your mum's condition is cause for concern. Primary caregivers of dementia sufferers face a great deal of stress and are at much higher risk of developing clinical depression. It would be wise to have your dad go into a nursing home NOW if possible. The time your mum would've spent caring for him could then be devoted to visiting him and spending more quality time with him. 

I also suggest talking to your mum about selling the house and buying something smaller that she can manage easily, perhaps a nice condo somewhere closer to your siblings.

What you should expect when you see your dad is that he likely won't be at his best. Dementia is a confounding, vexing disease. Some days patients can be lucid and bright and wonderful, other days they can be down, and moody and laconic. As the disease progresses, the down days become more frequent than the good days.

Simple questions for your dad like what your mum suggested are a solid approach. Mid-stage dementia patients often have trouble making broad decisions. Simplify it for them by giving them two, or at most, three choices. Also, don't force your reality on your dad. If he complains about how your mum never visits (even though she was there half an hour prior), just nod and tell him she's on her way, or that she promised to see him in the morning. Go along with his confabulations, and lie with the knowledge that these untruths you're playing along with are therapeutic for your dad.

I get your pain, and confusion, and worry. Hang in there. Enjoy the time you have left with your dad. Help him live out the rest of his time with dignity and in emotional peace.",,,,DeepBoil,,,1446068305,t5_2rfqf,t3_3qksl5,t3_3qksl5,2,1447261356,0,0,cwge9rx,dementia,2,,
"Wow! I really feel for you. My mom's judgement and short term memory are impaired, but she's social and communicates without any problems. I'm having a hard enough time with the realization that she's not quite the same woman who raised me, who I depended upon as a child and by whose presence I derived comfort and security, and can't imagine how I would feel if she wasn't always mentioning various occasions and other recollections from my childhood. I think urinating in the bathtub you should just let her do; it's liquid that will go down the drain and isn't the health risk that feces are. I'm unsure about the defecation since that does contain lots and lots of microbes/bacteria. Are you male or female? If you're female, it might not be too intrusive for you to accompany her to the bathroom and just make sure she's going to use the toilet before exiting and letting her finish on her own. As for constant monitoring, who's present at any given time of the day, you, your dad, the caregiver? Are there more than one of you present throughout the day? I know what it's like wanting her to have supervision 24/7, so it might be useful for there to be two people present throughout the day, where the two switch off on dedicated monitoring shifts. Absent that, where it's too much on your plate and you can't keep up, a residential care facility may be the best option. It's hard, and you just want to tell her to think and have her understand, but that's not going to happen, which is emotionally crushing.",,,,argyle47,,,1444128670,t5_2rfqf,t3_3nntsf,t3_3nntsf,2,1446800741,0,0,cvpyaf7,dementia,2,,

"The days before we moved my mom into her nursing home we were so worried that once she got there they would take one look at her and say ""nope, she's too much, we can't handle her"". We were incredibly honest with the nursing home (which was a memory care facility) and they never once flinched but my dad and I were really worried that they weren't buying how bad it really was. My mother had aphasia so she completely lost her ability to talk, so we didn't even know what insane thoughts she was having. She would throw these massive, animalistic tantrums where she would scream horrible, guttural screams and bite and hit and scratch (how could a tiny frail woman be sooooo strong???) her caregivers who really loved her all quit when she shit her pants and threw them at the main woman and chased her around the house.

I brought her to the nursing home for her intake. This should have been fine. She loved riding in the car and most of the time really calmed her down but for some reason once I got her in the lobby she started punching me in the face, screaming at the top of her lungs and totally freaking out. I was mortified and utterly convinced that this was over. My dad and I had already talked about how we guessed our only option would be a mental hospital. The administrators quickly swept to my side, deftly separated me from my mom and took me on a tour of the facility (read; took me to my moms new room and explained to me how they are equipped to handle my mom while I tried to stop crying)

About 20 minutes later a nurse came in and said ""your mom is dancing and holding the hands of another resident"" sure enough, she was in her element. The place was meant for her from the lay out of the building to the amazing staff. She wasn't supposed to be moved in until Monday, this was the Thursday before. The head admin said ""look, don't take her home. She doesn't know it's her home, she doesn't need time to say goodbye to her things. Just go. We'll get it from here""

When I got back home to my parents house I suddenly felt what the absence of her was and I knew she couldn't come back. I hadn't realized how on guard I was every second in that house until she wasn't there.

She had some bad days in that home, including biting another resident, and one night that was so bad they actually had to have my dad come and help them calm her down, but they never threatened to kick her out. This is what dementia is and this is what these wonderful people do to help us. ",,,,SarahMakesYouStrong,,,1446207332,t5_2rfqf,t3_3qtuqz,t3_3qtuqz,3,1447293621,0,0,cwi9mav,dementia,3,,

"Reading this brought tears to my eyes, I am just contemplating picking up the phone to call him now because I know that there is a carer there at the moment that will hold the phone for him. Each time I speak to him or think about speaking to him I want to cry. It brings me such rage. We were so damn close, when I needed advice I'd go to him, we had so much in common and that is gone now. He was a towering figure and loved by so many, but they fled when his dementia got worse, they couldn't cope seeing him like that. 
I can tell just from this experience with him that emotional memory definitely seems to hold on the longest. He can't remember or speak about much, but he knows I am his daughter and he knows that I am living abroad but that I am happy. 

But he misses me and asks constantly when I am going to visit, sometimes he will say that he is going to pick me up from the airport tomorrow. It breaks my heart because we can't afford the trip at the moment. 
It usually takes me about an hour on a good day to rein in my sadness. The problem is that so many people just don't get it, its usually something associated with much older people and is viewed coldly as part of ageing but my Dad is only in his 60's! As is yours, this should not be happening! When I see my in-laws and how much they are enjoying retirement I get so sad. That should have been him and my mother, he devoted his working life to helping people and doing good, he should have been able to retire in peace and do all the things he wanted to.
 
Sometimes I feel selfish because I can't bare the pain of talking to him and so I don't call. Which makes me feel so terrible. I'm not there, I don't see him everyday, so I should call him every day. But it just takes such a toll. Some days he is better than others and his face is bright and he will talk about things that make sense only to him and laugh. Other days there is nothing there and its those days, when I just see his confusion and frustration on his face because he can't get out what he wants to say that just destroy me.

"Your odds are higher. I'd have to dig for the actual citations, but the odds of developing dementia are one in four -- if you're in your nineties.

That's the most important point. Genetics don't play anywhere near the role that age does as far as risk factors go for dementia. The older you get the, the greater your risk of developing some form of dementia (which by all accounts is a complex disease with many facets and contributing factors). IIRC after 60 or so your chances of developing dementia doubles every five years you remain alive. But also note that dementia is *not* predestined. Just because both of your parents have it doesn't mean that you *will* get it. Your risk is higher, but not dramatically so.

I got advice from some source or other that advised that diverting attention away or hiding/masking the undesired option is a good tactic. My mom uses the microwave from time to time, which was having disastrous results since she'd put a cup of coffee in to warm it up, which wouldn't normally be bad, but the stupid thing has a button labeled, ""Reheat"", which I'm not sure what the manufacturers had in mind since it nukes whatever is in there so intensely that it was causing the coffee to boil and bubble with explosive spurts, leaving a mess. I ended up covering the despised button with a taped on label with the word, ""No"", written on it, and that has done the trick. I did the same thing with the TV and digital converter box (the TV/cable set up is in the family room, and she uses non-cable in the bedroom before going to sleep) remote controls, which was really problematic since you use one to turn on the TV and another to turn on the digital converter and change channels, so I've taped over all the buttons that she's not supposed to use on each remote control.",,,,argyle47,,,1444245447,t5_2rfqf,t3_3nntsf,t1_cvri11x,1,1446829324,0,0,cvrlyka,dementia,1,,

"I could (easily) be very wrong since, as mentioned, you might want to see if what you're describing is dyspraxia. HOWEVER! I would ask your GP for a iron and folate blood count. Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia can cause disorganisation, confusion, irritability, depression and dementia. Luckily it's very treatable with a diet change to increase your vitamin intake, or short-term or chronic treatment with iron or folic acid tablets. Link to the NHS page below:

http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Anaemia-vitamin-B12-and-folate-deficiency/Pages/Symptoms.aspx

I was diagnosed with folate deficiency anaemia when I was 14 but resisted medication. I've done irreparable damage to the neurons in my extremities, although my dementia and lethargy is entirely gone when I take my medication now that I'm back adhering to the doctor's orders. So if you think this is a possibility, seriously go get your bloods done. ",,,,Sleebean,,,1445981947,t5_2rfqf,t3_3jcste,t3_3jcste,1,1447239122,0,0,cwf3x0x,dementia,1,,

Younger, and younger, and younger. And that doesn't include, as the story says, many, many, many who are considered to young to have the dread disease but are actually in the first phase of the horror that will gradually, sometimes within several months, engulf them -- all while the overpriced and blinkered medical professions, especially psychologists and psychiatrists, that, rather than who, pretend to be experts and should be working as toilet cleaners, shrug them off and fill them with zombie drugs. Damn them, these vampires. The only saving grace is that this growing epidemic will result in different avenues of research that might ultimately find a non-drug way to help reprogram these/our constantly changing brains to not only cope but actually improve so-called human intelligence.

It seems like you have a strong enough handle on this situation to not be trying to get any fathering out of him but I would focus on improving his immediate reality when you visit.

I don't feel comfortable advising on your children since I don't have any my self but my instinct says to leave them at home. He will become increasingly irrational and those aren't the lasting memories you what to give your kids.

It's like having a toddler that you can't strap into a car seat or put in time out or put on a changing table to clean a dirty diaper. You should go see her every single day for an entire month and help out with the nursing staff before you seriously consider this. Maybe she isn't in a good nursing home - is she in one that focuses on ""memory care""?

I haven't had to deal with it personally but i would say its best to try and distract and reassure them you will help them. They can get into quite a mood so its better to say that you will try and help look for the items shortly but perhaps you could offer them first something to drink for example to distract them.

"Late to the party, but we had very good results with trazodone as a sleeping pill at night.  It's also for anxiety, so ask your doc.  Also, it may be cheaper to hire an overnight caregiver a few nights per week than admitting him somewhere.

Find a large curtain rod and cover the exit doors at night with drapes to disguise them.  Sometimes works very well.    Read the book ""Contented Dementia""  if you haven't already.   Watch the Teepa Snow videos on YouTube.

Sometimes a normal household is too chaotic.  Memory units are very bland, quiet places and everyone thinks they are terrible, but the residents have less stimulation/agitation.  See if you can arrange to visit the home that he likely will go to.  Observe how he does, some places will let you have a meal to see how things go.   Observing him in that environment might give you insight as to whether or not he is ready.

Best of luck deciding.  We have had two parents with dementia and eventually go into care.  There's no black or white, do your best and don't feel that you've made a wrong decision.  There are no ""right"" decisions anymore, there is only coping.

As to the kids, remember that what you teach them know is how you're asking them to care for you when you get older. I'd take them along until they are at the age where they can decide whether to go or not (like Church). You know what's best for your family.

My husband is the latest I know and I got him off the sugar etc and HE IS GETTING BETTER! He may never get all the way back but this is so mind blowing. 

All the ones I know/knew were sugar and baked goods junkies and most had diabetes. When I did my stint in a carehome (I am a CNA) all the dementia patients sucked down cookies and candy. 

Oh and sugar raises cholesterol and the statins can cause diabetes which can lead to dementia.

"To be honest I would say it is a bad idea to bring her home, unless you plan on hiring a 24 hr nurse. Even she is falling in a facility she most likely will fall at your place more. If you are worried about the facility check it out yourself, go and visit but focus on other patients there and see how the care staff responds. MAke sure there is things being done like lightbulb a changed quickly,wet floor signs being utilized, wheelchair alarms being attached. In the late stages of dementia and in just deteriorating health falls happen. This facility is probably designed to minimize that as much as possible (no steps, locked doors, straight halls). Dementia is hard on the patient and a lot of cases equally as hard on the families, a flinch upon a hug could mean so many different things, it could possibly be abuse but most likely it was a lapse of memory failure at the moment. I talk to my residents daily and even some of my most loving will sometimes treat me differently, he'll I just got told by a resident today that I was fired because she didn't remember hiring me to work in her building, 20 minutes later she was asking about my girls.

Also with the weight loss it could be a few things but is pretty common. If they put her on a medication regiment maybe they could alter it to have her more docile during the times she usually falls.
