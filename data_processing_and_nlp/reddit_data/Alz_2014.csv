"My grandfather had late onset alzheimer's, my grandmother currently has vascular dementia, and Im currently a PhD student studying Alzheimer's disease. Its not possible for a definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's to be given pre-mortem, so your doctor will likely use a number of tests to determine which of the three is most likely. 

What I can tell you however, is that there is no treatment for any of the three diseases. There are some drugs and lifestyle changes you can make which make slow the progression of symptoms, but nothing exists currently that can alter the course of the diseases themselves. 

I have thought about this a lot after watching my grandparent's progression through the diseases, and considered the fact that my parents and one day I myself may get the disease... It's pretty fucked up to say this, but it's only going to get worse. There are good days and bad days, but my own personal opinion is that in your situation I would utilize these times of relatively lucidity. I would go on long vacations together, etc... share the time you have together now.

"[The Alzheimers Society website](http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/factsheet/405) says that people with two copies of the APOE ε4 gene have a tenfold increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in their later years, but even then they are not certain to develop it. Also, I don't think men are at as high a risk as women with the this condition (see [this article](http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2012/06/study-shows-common-genetic-risk-factor-for-alzheimers-disrupts-brain-function-in-healthy-older-women-but-not-men.html)). Plus, by the time you'd be likely to develop Alzheimer's — about 35 years from now at the earliest — treatments should be available to cure or prevent it. That said, the risk is still there, so it can only do you good to maintain a healthy lifestyle, if not because of the Alzheimer's then because of everything else. I don't know about the ginkgo biloba or the DHA, but certainly the other things you mentioned, especially exercise, are good habits to form at your age.

"Your mum is lucky to have such a supportive family. I think Alzheimer's is harder on the caretakers than the patient, since the patient becomes less and less cognizant of what is happening to them while the caretakers watch the changes become more and more debilitating.

Keep in mind at all times that your mum simply *cannot do* things she used to do, so avoid saying things like, ""Don't you remember...,"" because she *can't*. Just repeat things as though it's for the first time, because for her it is. It's heartbreaking and frustrating at first, but you get into the rhythm of it and settle into a new way of communicating with your ""new"" mum. If people correct her, she will start to withdraw.

You will start to feel like you're treating her like a child, and in some ways you are, but it's just to keep her safe and as healthy as possible. It's difficult to treat her like a child while thinking of her as the person she always was, but you can do it, and I believe that on some level she will appreciate it.

"1: Yes, in my experience it is common.  My mother in law has Alzheimers and my grandmother had it as well.  Both of them in the fairly early stages were prone to strip down to nude and walk around the house regardless of if I was in the room or not.  My MIL is(was) a very prim and proper religious woman and would be absolutely beside herself if she knew she had done this.

2: Yes.

She wound up putting dirty dishes under the sink because she didn't remember what to do with them so she stashed them.

3: Yes, my MIL lost better than 80lbs during her first few years after diagnosis because she wouldn't eat.  She was never hungry....These days (late stage) we've got to put all her food in a food processor and grind it up before we give it to her.  She still eats well but can't or won't chew much and if anything is too big to swallow without chewing she chipmunks it.

"Snugy, 
I'm sorry to hear you are in a similar situation and I wish I had a better update for you, but here is where we are:
We had one disaster with a company that ended up not having the knowledge to handle alzheimers patients. Back at the starting gate, we did a lot more homework and after lots of interviews with private care givers and companies, we found a lady who came with glowing recommendations from her past employers and hired her.  My grandmother was incredibly resistant to having anyone in the house.  We tried every approach we could think of-she's just a friend visiting, she's new to the area and needs odd jobs to do, she's here to help your husband not you, etc.  NOTHING working. My grandmother spent the entire time the caregiver was in the house fretting about why she was there, getting upset and demanding the caregiver leave.  My grandfather bore the brunt of it, but he quickly learned not to engage in an argument with my grandmother.  The caregiver lasted 3 long, terrible weeks before we all decided that it wasn't a good fit.

For now, it is a family effort to give my grandfather respite.  Her Alzheimers has progressed enough that she is no longer as argumentative when we are helping around the house and she will even let us wash her hair once in a while, which is a big win for us! We are hoping that this means we can try introducing home care again in the near future, but for now, we are providing all care. 

I know this wasn't as helpful as you were hoping.  It is a terrible disease for everyone around.  I have learned incredible patience, frustration, resentment and guilt during the past 4 years. Alzheimers is a marathon grieving process, slowly watching the person you love slip away, that can overwhelm your whole world.  I hope you have a support system set up, because as a caregiver, you will need as much as you can get!

On a more positive note, here are things that help me give my grandmother the best care:
She will do anything if I tell her it's to help someone else. I love that about her!
Take the fall for everything.  I often hear ""I didn't know you were coming over, etc.""  and my reply is always ""I'm sorry I forgot to tell you..""
You don't have to engage in the repetitive stories every time. 
As best you can, try to keep your conversation voice genuine. I found myself speaking to her like she was 7 many times, and now I work hard on talking to her like I used to, even if she doesn't follow. 

Best of luck to you and your family. If you have any other questions, I'm happy to help as much as I can. ",false,true,t1_citgggd,cheeseisforbreakfast,,0,1404997828,t5_2r8fp,t3_219fpm,t1_cisbwmj,2,1434642386,0,0,citgggd,Alzheimers,2,,,

"That's a fantastic idea and in fact the one I came up with after days of struggling with the problem :))

First I put gloves on and explained they were a deterrent re nose infection, which she understood but instantly took them off, unable to remember why they were on. Then I tried a mitten on her non-dominant hand and threaded cotton through the wrist part and tied that off so she could not get it off. Which resulted in her being mildly but increasingly distressed about why it was on and how she could get it off and so distracted by that, she spent her entire day trying to puzzle out why she had it on and what she could use to get it off. But, that worked over a couple of days for her to get over the massive nose infection. 

Geez, AD is a difficult difficult disease to practically and creatively deal with. Current problem is she's forgotten about garbage bins and about putting garbage in there. So she's stuffing everything down the kitchen sink, tucking used tissues in little hidden corners, walking around with empty yogurt containers up and down up and down wondering where to put them... Last night when I prevented her from pushing her left over food down the plug hole (Id just had to plunge and caustic soda it free) she got cross and just dropped her plate on the floor, then (because she genuinely did not remember just dropping it) said I'd broken the plate.

"Our Mission:
Remember Me wants to provide people with pins with a specific logo that would represent in a discrete way that the person wearing the pin has Alzheimer’s.
We are creating a pin that will allow strangers to know that the person wearing it has Alzheimer’s, while at the same time sparing that person from having to be reminded of it all the time.
This pin also has the potential to save lives. Say a person wearing the pin was walking by himself. In this case a stranger wouldn't have to hesitate and could notify authorities right away and reunite that person with their family.
The logo is bold and noticeable but it is abstract enough that the person wearing it won't feel like they have a sign on them.
PLEASE HELP SPREAD THE WORD. This is the most important part of this campaign. We need people to be able to recognize the symbol so that they can help the people wearing them. People with Alzheimer’s are still people with feelings and emotions. They may have short term memory, but they live in the moment and they like to be social and feel independent. Let’s come together to make their lives and the lives of their caretakers more comfortable.

"Im not super familiar with sugar directly, but cholesterol plays a large role in Alzheimer's disease for a number of reasons:

first and foremost, cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's are linked. What this means is if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, etc... you have a higher risk for Alzheimers... higher cholesterol levels therefore increase your risk for both diseases. I dont want to get too complicated, but cholesterol has a number of further more molecular level effects which are thought to be negative in the context of Alzheimer's.

"My family noticed similar symptoms in my mom, who was recently diagnosed with early onset (she's 62, been exhibiting symptoms for about 5 years). My two sisters and I talked to our dad about it quite a bit before we got him to take any action, because he was in quite a bit of denial about it. When he finally admitted that there was an issue, we took her to see several kinds of doctor and culminated in a series of neurologist visits. The neurologist performed mental acuity tests over the course of several months and took brain scans before diagnosing her. 

With my mom, it was hard. The diagnosis almost helped by breaking down the barrier of denial with her and my dad. They started taking action - like getting her on meds, joining support groups, and my workaholic dad started taking more time off to spend with her and to make sure she's getting as much social interaction as possible.

She retired a few years ago, which made it hard to keep her social. Please, please, please keep your mom social as much as you can. If she can keep working, make sure she keeps working, keeps using her brain. I don't know whether it would have helped my mom, but there was a rapid, rapid decline in my mom's mental ability when she retired. That was when we really started to notice that something was up. She went from a pediatric nurse practitioner to someone who couldn't figure out the remote control in a year or so. 

We also try to keep her anxiety levels low. She knows that she can't remember everything, so she often stresses about little tasks and things. We try to break them down for her as much as possible, and try to make sure she's busy. If she only has one agenda item for the week, she'll stress out about it all week. It helps to keep her busy.

"I did look at them. that article was from 2001. You really think if melatonin reversed alzheimer's disease in 2001 it wouldn't be a mainstream approach by now? ApoE4 is a risk factor for Alzheimer's, and most certainly has pathogenic effects on the disease. but melatonin reversal of it's profibrillogenic effects is in no way going to completely reverse Alzheimer's.

Why on earth would you think people are suppressing information on Alzheimer's disease? It's a world epidemic which is only going to rise in prevalence, and everyone is scared shitless that they will get it, because if you live long enough, you probably will. Perhaps it doesn't get the attention we would hope in the media, but no one is sweeping it under the rug.

Alzheimer's patients have a lot more going wrong with them than niacin and melatonin deficiencies. You seem to know a very small portion of the whole picture and are very dead-set on convincing yourself that its the whole story.

Here's a really nice review published in Cell fairly recently. There's probably a newer one but this will be good enough for your purposes. http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(12)00278-4

Your passion is justified, and as a graduate student studying Alzheimer's disease I assure you I share that passion. But latching onto the first promising studies you find and disregarding everything else is not going to solve this epidemic. I urge you to get educated and continue to stay interested. Perhaps donate to an Alzheimer's disease research foundation.

And please, seriously, blood pressure medication directly reduces the risk for Alzheimer's disease. It in no way shape or form causes the disease. Your fear of Pharmaceutical companies' intentions is irrational for one reason: Alzheimer's disease is a disease of aging. As our health care gets better we get an older and older population... leading to more people getting Alzheimer's disease. If the pharmaceutical companies could treat Alzheimer's disease they would do so in a heartbeat. They stand to gain huge profits from the treatment of the disease, and dont need to fear about ever losing the patients, because new people will always get old and get Alzheimer's disease to replace them.",false,false,t1_cmpdtbi,BioLogicMC,,0,1418094921,t5_2r8fp,t3_2ome7k,t1_cmpcnr5,6,1425531520,0,0,cmpdtbi,Alzheimers,6,,,

Either way, as people live longer and longer, calling someone 65 ""old"" may not be as accurate as it once was.

"I recently read a book, [The Validation Breakthrough](http://www.amazon.com/The-Validation-Breakthrough-Third-Edition/dp/1932529934), which I found helpful in understanding my husband's behavior. The book focuses on very old people (I don't know how old your dad is), and theorizes that the particular behaviors that a dementia patient falls into are expressions of issues he's never been able to work through over the course of his life.

It might be a worthwhile exercise to play amateur psychiatrist — not to your dad but as a thought experiment for yourself. Your dad must feel great shame for having nearly drunk himself to death, and he must be relieved that you are limiting your alcohol intake. It could be a double relief for him to think that migraines are what caused you to stop drinking, since migraines were the reason he drank (even though they weren't — here's where the confusion comes in). As for the standing issue, perhaps someone was always telling him to ""Stand up straight!"" (moms are notorious for this). He may feel guilty about not being the obedient child, and the guilt comes out as pain when he stands too long. Explanations like this may be completely far-fetched, but mulling them over might give you some insight and compassion for your dad's increasing helplessness in holding himself together.

It's great that you ""don't call him out on anything and just smoothly move past it."" *The Validation Breakthrough* would take it a step further and suggest that you actually go along with — validate — his lies, not in a phony, pandering way but to help him resolve any issues that still might be resolvable. The author provides a list of specific communication techniques to try. The idea is to prevent the person from withdrawing, which will only accelerate the progression of the dementia.

"Sounds like unusual behaviour. The loss of recently learned information and skills are the cardinal cognitive changes of Alzheimer's disease, but several differential diagnoses need to be made. Delerium, Urinary Tract Infection, medication interactions can all lead to disorientation and problems with thinking skills as can normal age-related cognitive change.

For a simple cognitive screener, that you can administer try the Mini Mental Status Exam or better still, Addenbrooks Cognitive Examination. Both are free and should be able to give you a baseline with minimal training. 

Best practice is always to go talk over these issues first with a treating health professional and then find a way to work together to support the process of getting her to come around to accept the value of an assessment. One way I find useful is to differentiate cognitive change from mental illness. Cognitive change with age is perfectly normal, our minds evolve over time, and aspects of thinking skills change over time. Some get better, some decline, but they are always changing. It is important to know how your thinking skills are holding up as these allow people to make fully informed decisions about life, including medical and personal care. The assessment is not about ""what"" you think, or even ""why"". It's about understanding your past history (medical, educational, vocational, social and psychological) because these make a difference in what levels of performance on testing that an examiner would typically expect to see. 

It sounds like a personal dynamic between you and your mother is also a barrier to her accepting referral to see someone. Maybe it's time to co-opt trusted others to a) explore your concerns and cross-validate them amongst those that interact regularly with her, b) discuss options for promoting attitude change, and c) reaffirm your concern and desire to help in the situation with respect.

If it's just you and your mum, with no other support or family, try going to a doctor or counsellor to discuss how to approach the issue.

"&gt; I just hate the thought that I will be forgotten, that I wont get to grow old with him as we expected to.

This is where the selflessness comes in. I have dealt with my husband's illness by focusing completely on him and putting myself on hold. Even when I need a break — to take a walk, to see friends, to get a manicure — my mindset is that I'm doing this to relieve the stress, to keep myself healthy for him. If he forgets me, it won't be that I'm forgotten; it will be that he deeply loved and appreciated me when he was able to, but that he just can't anymore. If I don't grow old with him, well, life goes on and I'll grow old with whomever is left in my life. People do it all the time.

Honestly, when my husband has a serious lapse — when he doesn't remember that he spent the prior week in the hospital — it makes my heart well up with tenderness for him and draws me to hug him for a long time. When, for the hundredth time, he accuses our nephew of stealing the silver, I validate whatever it was that brought him to say such things — not ""No, he didn't steal the silver,"" but ""Well, he was always an ornery one, wasn't he?""

"Depending on how much she remembers/forgets here's some ideas.

- You can tell her the people are family friends just there to check in on her.
- You can tell her that the person is someone they've known for a long time. (Usually proud dementia / Alzheimer's patients will play along like 'yeah I knew that') 
- Inform the company you need a regular caregiver so her schedule will be the same and same person. Usually the companies are good about that.

Can you tell me more about how she is? What does she need help with exactly? (Potty, transfers, errands, etc) How does she act when her routine is changed? What is her reaction if you were to tell her that someone's coming to help her?

"You are a saint, too — to spend every available moment at your parents' house. My husband has Alzheimer's and I am his primary caregiver. I can assure you that you are a godsend to your mom. I'm sure your being there is a great comfort to both her and your dad.

One of the big problems I see with Alzheimer's is that it's hard to know how much the person understands about his own condition, or if he is even aware that he is ill. All we can do is try our best to get ""in the moment"" with them and try to see the world the way they see it, which, from what I can tell, can change from minute to minute as their attention is buffeted about by occurrences great and small. So it's easy for them to misinterpret what's going on. But the misinterpretation may not last very long because the next thing will happen and the world will change again.

Still, I can understand how heartbreaking it must be to have someone you love so much feel bad and apologize for something they didn't actually do. Your dad may have thought for a moment that you were mad at him for his crown coming out, but I'm sure that your overall care and continued reassurances soothed things over at the emotional level, which I think has a more lasting effect than whatever he thought happened.

We treated it that she was too sick to be at home right now.

They adapt. It helps with a routine that everyday the same thing happens at the same time. They may become attached to a single pair of pants or shirt. If that's the case, buy more of the same short or pants to allow for laundering.

There are organizations that will provide you with a volunteer caregiver that will come to your house for a few hours. Think of them as a babysitter. They will keep your grandfather company while your parents escape the house for a few hours to do some errand running, grab a coffee. Go to a park and read. It's typically just for a few hours.

Check your local nursing home, sometimes they have 'day programs' for seniors. The one in my town has a weekly tea, with members of the community coming in to make and serve the tea and providing some cookies. They sometimes also have craft or activity afternoons. I'm not sure at what level your grandfather is at, but see if your local nursing home offers these programs.

Check local colleges/high schools. Do they have a seniors care program they offer? See if they have any programs to give their students a chance to work hands on, directly, with a senior. I'm not saying that you should sell out your grandfather, but it will be a win-win situation for both your parents and your grandfather.

Also there are Alzheimer support groups for families that have a loved one that suffer from Alzheimer's. I put my parents in touch with their local branch in British Columbia when my grandmother was diagnosed.

"I understand there's a strong correlation between pain and anger/anxiety attacks in AD patients. 

So, when my mum has an attack of either anger/anx, I tend to give her prescribed pain meds. I've not had to go over the prescribed doses, and it does seem to help. Usually with my mum, she gets extremely anxious in the afternoon and I think it's usually her back that starts to give her hell by then - she has a miniature Poodle who she picks up and carries around all day and she cannot remember that causes her backache. Not sure if there could be some pain related trigger with your mom at 2a.m. tho! Maybe worth a shot, just to see if pain meds stop her behaviour. If they do, maybe its time to see the Dr again to identify what may be causing the pain, or even, if it is that or not.

My dad takes care of her full time. She was going to a group day care 2 times a week for about 6 hours a day and that was my dad’s free time/get the house clean time. In the last 6 months she had deteriorated quite badly and can’t go to the day care any more so my dad has a care aid come to the house Monday and Wednesday for 5 hours. 

Two or three years ago she was wondering out of the house and at one point put the wooden cutting board on the stove top and turned it on high. Now she wouldn’t even be able to find the dial on the stove to turn it on. Taking her clothes off was a big thing that she did for a while too. It’s lucky (maybe not for my dad) that we are able to have him be with her full time. It’s just gotten to the point where it would be safer for her if she was somewhere with people who are trained and there is medical care close to her.

This situation happens often with people that have dementia. She might be able to recognize you over the phone, but not in person. In person she has visual cues that might not be matching what she remembers. She might remember you as a young girl and not the individual that you are today. So when she sees you instead of seeing her granddaughter, she sees a strange woman in her house and comes to conclusions that can seem hurtful. Perhaps when she sees you with your Dad this is an additional visual cue that triggers more of an understanding that you are someone important to her (though she still might not fully recognize you). The important thing to remember is that it is not truly her that is getting angry at you, but the disease that is causing her to become confused, and perhaps frightened, which causes her behavior. While I know no sure fire fix for this situation using additional visual cues and very gentle reminders might help her recognize that you are someone important to her and not just a random woman.

If you can find a support group for caretakers of people with dementia in your area, that can be immensely helpful.

It is incredibly difficult to remain calm and positive at all times, so forgive yourself if you struggle or act in a way that you wish you hadn't. As the disease progresses, communication is more difficult, but keep in mind that the person is left with the feeling of the conversation, even if they can't fully comprehend the words or express themselves.

I told him that my husband would not mention any memory problems, and asked him if he, the doctor, would broach the subject. So at his appointment, after discussing my husband's other health concerns, the doctor said, ""Have you noticed any changes in your ability to remember things?""

My husband was a bit taken aback but I think relieved to have the subject out in the open among familiar, caring people (the doctor and me). He said, ""I have noticed that I misplace things more often than I used to..."" and went on to describe some other changes, like forgetting words or what day it is.

"Hey...

So, couple of questions -

Have your dad and your grandma taken your grandpa to the doctor?  Have any medications been prescribed?

If not, that would be a good step to take.  I guess you already know you can't cure alzheimer's, but some of the symptoms can possibly be calmed down a bit with the right medications.

Here's a site that says it's for the people helping people who have alzheimer's, so it might be a good place to check out:

* [http://www.alzheimers.gov/](http://www.alzheimers.gov/)

Here are a couple of other web sites:

* [http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers](http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers)

* [http://www.alz.org/](http://www.alz.org/)

I know it's really weird - You tell him over and over, and you keep expecting, at least once in a while, that he'll go ""Oh, wait, wait, did we have this same conversation last night?"", but that never happens, and they can seem so normal, even when they're forgetting what happened just 2 minutes ago, it seems impossible that there's no trace at all in their memory.

Anyway, hopefully there'll will be something on one of these web sites that gives you some tools or resources for better understanding and easier management of the situation.

"I want to start this off with saying please forgive me. I'm on an ipad and I'm not sure how to format things correctly or have perfect grammar. My grandma passed away in January after a very long battle with Alzheimer's. I am 23 now and I was still pretty young when she was diagnosed but she raised me and it was devastating. My mother who was 19 when I was born now frequently expresses immense regret for not getting my grandmother to a doctor sooner. Although I was young a lot of what you're saying resonates with me. The phone thing first. When I was around 13 cell phones were still a fairly new and advanced concept but my grandmother who was around 57 juSt could not figure them out but in an extreme way. I would also like to point out my grandma is seriously the most kind or was sorry but was the most kind, loving, patient and beautiful woman I have ever had the privilege of knowing. That being said, Alzheimer's turned her stubbornness into levels I couldn't imagine. I say this not out of knowledge but of experience with her that the stubbornness is born from fear of losing control. I believe that people suffering with this develop (and in your case more to the extreme) their stubbornness more out of a wa.y to assure themselves that they have control over what's happening to them. They wNt to admit they may have a disorder as much as you want to hear it. It's a hard fight but I believe you absolutely must get her to a doctor. Also, I don't know your financial situAtions as ours were bad but. Y grandmother would forget she took her pills and take more or just not take them at all. It's probably important to have someone there to help with that. Either way,  I want you to know I'm sorry this subreddit isn't ore active, I've searched far and wide for a decent place to express my grief and not only have I not found one but this seems to be only a subreddit to advertise elderly care. I also know this is random but I've never been able to share it and I feel now and here is a good of time as any. When I was 14 and this was the first time I had ever heard my grandma curse and she had raised me. Anyway, we got in the car because this was before anyone had realized she couldn't drive. She wanted to take me to Sonic and we were in the car for a good two minutes without her starting it when she threw the keys and ran out of the garage. I followed her to her room where she was sobbing. I held her and asked her what was wrong her reply was ""it's this damn Alzheimer's I don't know what to do"" and she sobbed into my shoulder for another half hour. I'm sorry for leaving that here but it has never left me and it has never failed to remind me that no god could exist in such a cruel world.",false,true,t1_cgbaduy,MarquisDeSadesGF,,0,1395728088,t5_2r8fp,t3_219lat,t3_219lat,8,1433057648,0,0,cgbaduy,Alzheimers,8,,,

"I'm sorry to hear about your mother. There's no easy path, that's the sad truth I think. Keep abreast on her health, and stop in and offer as much love as you can - but be careful not to entirely forsake your own life in the process.

I used to be an Activity Director at a memory care facility. Everyone is there to help. My best advice would be to establish rapport with the staff, indicate your mom's hobbies and passions; keep an eye on monthly activity schedules, and make sure your mom's interests are accounted for, while also knowing that people that create those lists have limited resources; and appreciate every moment you share, as we all should when we're with loved ones. 

The best advice is to keep her mind and body as active as possible. Find what keeps her busy, and happy, and try and provide it as best you can - while also accounting for your own life.

On his good days its no problem but on his bad days it just ends in frustration, anger and tears. I have suggested several times to get a caregiver but they are still in denial on how much work this is.


Second realize that as the disease progresses, your grandma will no longer be the person you grew up with. Meaning that at times she will not remember or understand what you are telling her. Again this is happening with my uncle and my parents. They insist on explaining to him logically why he shouldn't drive at night (for example) and my uncle either doesn't remember or hasn't yet realized his own limitations and then gets lost.

But in addition to the extra sensory experiences that he has with the dog, he also may have more motor experiences (from petting; procedural memory involves different brain circuits that are less affected in AD), and is perhaps also around her so much of the time. Even in cases of dense memory loss, some encoding and retrieval seems to occur. Finally, he may be more emotionally attached to her at this point in his life, and we know that emotional memories are better preserved.

"I do not know yet how to deal with a beloved husband who is slipping away. When he is lucid, he wants me to never lie to him. So when he gets mad at me for giving his car to his father to drive and it will not come back in good shape as his father never takes care of anything, I do tell him his father has been dead for 5 years and the car isn't coming back. Then he says, I missed a page. 

My sister moved in to help and is in his bedroom he had as a child. This is now confusing him. I think I can recommend not living in the house an Alzheimer's person grew up in! Can't be helped now. 

But I don't deserve to be an emotional punching bag either. I took care of my Father in law for 10 years and now my husband. I learned that when they get/got angry and start in yelling about nonsense things, if you say ""I am sorry you are sick, I don't deserve for you to take it out on me"", it stops. FIL would stomp off to his room and then forget, husband goes into a I am sorry, I was treated so badly I am lashing out to protect myself from being criticized. And talk about how he never did anything right. (not true, very talented) 

That could start a side rant about parents who never praised their kids and spent the kids life telling them it was never good enough. 

There seems to be an idea that because some one is mentally ill/Alzheimers/bipolar that since they can't help it we have to take what they dish out and be ""understanding"" 

I don't know yet where it is going with the husband, I am doing the best I can and so far, no help from the medical at all. He can still hold it together with a doctor and the damned social worker who came out and declared he wasn't bad enough for me to have help yet. 

I will probably be downvoted, but I have spent the last 15 years taking care of dementia/Alzheimers, a crippled mother in law before that, a sick first husband for two years and a mentally ill mother as a child/teen. 

I knew how to deal with all until it got to the husband. I will figure it out. Maybe this thread will help me. Reddit has helped with all else for years.

"We had a long delay between when my sisters and I noticed symptoms to when she went to the DRs, primarily because she and my dad were both so resistant. My maternal grandmother also had alzheimer's later on in life, so I think they were terrified of the diagnosis, too. 

My dad got confronted with some irrefutable proof of memory issues (beyond what he could rationalize as typical forgetfulness or lack of paying attention) when they went to visit friends in the city where I grew up. They were at a dinner party, and my mother told a story that could not be right, was obvious to the entire dinner party that it was not right, and my mom got aggressive when they tried to correct her. All of the people there were old family friends, and it took that embarrassing situation to get my dad to admit that there was an issue. 

After that, my dad reluctantly crossed over to mine and my sisters' side (as much as there are sides in this kind of situation). My eldest sister and my dad talked with my mom a lot about seeing a DR as a precautionary measure. I think it was always premised as a ""It couldn't hurt to see if something's up."" visit, and stressed that if we found nothing we could go on with our lives, and if we found something we could get treatment ASAP. 

That all being said, my sisters and I got a lot of flak from the other family members for a while. My brother thought we were being mean to her, and stayed adamant that nothing was wrong until (I think) the diagnosis. It was tough, but we knew something was wrong, so we kind of kept persistent. But to be honest, I'm still trying to find the ""right"" way to work with and talk to my mom.

I don't think of my husband as a child — I think of him as the person he's always been — I just arrange things to keep him as safe, healthy, and happy as I can. I try to get into his world as best I can. If he asked me what the hell the Chromecast was, I'd show him how it worked as if it were the first time, since as far as he's concerned he's never seen the thing before. After a while you overcome your frustration and get into the rhythm of repeating things ten times as though each time was the first time.

Maybe you can get him to the doctor for a ""routine checkup,"" or maybe you can identify some other health concern that he has and encourage him to go to the doctor for that. This is what I did.

There's not one answer for everyone as people react differently when they learn of their condition. However, may I suggest that gentle, agreeable persuasion may be a good approach. But don't be in a hurry. There's little that can be done for people living with Alzheimer's and dementia except to be supportive of them. Emotional support being the most important.

It really isn't critical that your dad is officially diagnosed right now. What's important is that he feels your support and is made to feel safe as his world begins to change. His fears and doubts will need to be addressed sympathetically and he'll benefit greatly from your positive, yet understanding support. 

Telling him that he's wrong or mistaken won't help him. In fact, it may even cause him more distress. The best you can do is to accept his misperceptions and allow him to believe whatever it is that he says he believes. If he doesn't get what you're saying, ask him what he thinks you're saying and accept that as the right explanation.

You, or someone, will eventually need to be more involved in his life in order to prevent any serious accident or injury. I hate to say it, but the time will come when he won't be safe to be left alone. He will need close care and attention.

I hope this helps.

"Well my husband, who has Alzheimer's or at least an Alzheimer's-like dementia, started drinking way more wine. It got to the point where he was drinking almost a whole bottle in one day. I think he truly forgot that he already had some, and he enjoys it so he would have some again.

His neurologist said that he should limit wine to 8 ounces per day because alcohol makes memory loss worse. At first I tried to get my husband to self-limit his intake. Every morning I would fill a wine bottle to the top from a boxed wine (hey, Bota Box chardonnay is pretty good). I'd point out to him that the bottle was full and that he should drink only about a third of it. When he drank way more, he'd swear the bottle was only half full to begin with. Sigh!

I love the person my grandmother was and want to care as well as possible for the person she is now. You seem to feel the same way about your father. 

Initially, I tried to draw on self control from work, teaching, managerial experience but that was just swallowing the frustration. 

The skillset that allowed me to reduce my stress actually came from videogames. Positive interaction and care is the objective, the quest, etc. The quest-giver may say any number of helpful, non-helpful, or even infuriating things. The escort-NPC may walk straight through a pack of mobs, the quest companion toon may be glitchy and infuriating. Goal doesn't change. 

I think of her as an NPC with faulty AI when she is not lucid, is rage-sundowning, hiding dirty garments, etc. and focus on my goal of positive interaction and care as the only way to make that moment productive. Grinds are not tons of fun, but they are done to serve a personal objective.   

In moments of lucidity, I try (well, tried -- she's very far along now) to really connect and have a loving moment. She cared for me as a child and the moments in which she knew she was loved and cared for were really special.     

They're only lies to us. For the dementia/Alzheimer's patient, it's just what's coming out of his/her mouth -- which is easy to know but hard to feel. I absolutely had to shift into ""malfunctioning unit: Grandmother-type"" to reduce the stress of her words, destructive impulses, promises to stay safely in bed quickly forgotten, etc. It might be frustrating, but I wouldn't get deeply emotionally involved with the output of any other malfunctioning unit I encountered.   

With bad decision-making, I approach it as a strategic challenge. What can I do to limit moves and make a safer/happier outcome more likely? Move a piece of furniture? Make sure a gate is securely locked? Take her pets out to walk while she's eating so she won't feed them her dinner? It doesn't always work, but it keeps the caregiver active in a disordered situation rather than always being on response/cleanup.

Best wishes to you and your father. Keep taking care of yourself, too -- It's so easy to get depleted by caregiving and neglect one's own life/health. ",false,false,t1_cm6ih8e,oddbuttons,,0,1416357885,t5_2r8fp,t3_2lzbre,t3_2lzbre,1,1425957514,0,0,cm6ih8e,Alzheimers,1,,,

"Our stories have some similarities. Although you and your mother are much much younger than my mom and I. 

I am an only child and my father died almost 10 years ago. 

There are a couple of drugs on the market that might slow the progress. Arisept and Nminda. (I am  not sure if those are the correct spellings.)  My mother has been on these for a few years. Her progress seemed slow for the first 3 years the past year she seemed to progress more quickly. 

I figured out my mom had some sort of dementia while I was pregnant with my twins 3 years ago. It was very hard to get a long with her. She argued about everything. Two summers ago I got her to agree to give me power of attorney both financial and medical. You should get those done as soon as possible.

"I know and I really hate to be the bearer of bad news, but as the other person said, there are a lot of great resources out there! And as I hope to be evidence of, there are a lot of great researchers dedicating their lives to finding more effective treatments! I know it's a pretty meaningless consolation prize for you right now, but as someone with loved ones who have passed from the disease (and speaking to others in the same situation), it feels good to know that hopefully soon other people won't have to go through this horror.

I want to stress one thing to you though: you are absolutely not the first thing he will forget! I dont know how long you two have been together, but my grandmother was the only thing he remembered at the end. He couldn't get out of bed/ a chair on his own, use the bathroom on his own, had no idea who I was, but every time we went to visit, he would ask for May. That was even more heartbreaking, because we had to tell him she had passed from cancer most times we went to visit, or choose to lie to him about it and say she would come soon or had just been there.

I really wish there was more I could say or offer, but just know you're not alone and your husband will not forget you until the very end! Take advantage of the time you have now, and remind him to do the same.

EDIT: and take lots of pictures NOW! The worst part about Alzheimer's and other dementia is the last few years it feels like its not really even them. When I think of my grandpa I think of two different people. I think of the brilliant, kind, hilarious man and I think of the heartbreak at seeing that man deteriorate. Its really helpful for me to be able to make that distinction. All the pictures I have with him are from before it got really bad, which makes remembering the good times easier. And once again, at 51 I know this is the last thing you want to hear right now, as you were probably expecting another 30+ years together. All I can offer at this point is my sincerest condolences and my promise that your story has only added fuel to my passion to find a treatment (I'm typing this from work going on hour 12 for the day). 

And one last thing: allow yourself to breakdown from time to time. As a man it doesn't shame me in the slightest to admit that I cried my eyes out many a time during the progression of my grandfather's disease. If you bottle it in you may snap at a time when your husband needs that cold calculating logic most. I'm no psychiatrist, just speaking from experience.

"My SO wants to feel in control, even though AD has removed it. A year ago we made a joint decision for him to move into assisted living. It has been helpful in our personal relationship as well as his overall health and stress. I work very hard to afford it, and it reduces our time together to about 2 hours a day during the week as I work but overall it had been positive.  Assisted living has actually given him a but more control than when we lived together.  In the beginning he was alone while I was at work so we had ""house rules"" for his safety (no going on long walks alone, don't use the stove alone etc) this frustrated him greatly and because of that I didn't trust that he would/could follow them. I would come home and the lunch I prepared before work would still be untouched in the fridge, he might have missed his noon meds even though I called to remind him etc.  He lost weight, and didn't have any to spare.  Since assisted living he has gained weight and I don't spend all of my energy caring for him, instead we go to Starbucks or lunch or dinner, or the zoo or a museum and spend our time enjoying each others company. It depends on how he is that day, we also might just talk or watch tv or take a short walk. When he moved in I felt I had failed, that was at fault for not being able to do it all alone. Now I am free to love him and give him real company instead of a stressed out, grumpy spouse. 

The hardest thing to learn was that things don't have to be right. Happiness is more important that correctness. When telling a story he would get a name or place wrong, and I would correct it. I went to a great talk with a doctor specializing in neuropsychiatry, and she emphasized that happiness is more important than correctness and it stuck with me.

"Try looking into ketogenic or low-carb diets. They are difficult to follow, but have been used for other neurological disorders, like epilepsy.  

There is also a variation called the ""MCT diet"" which allows more carbs...but you have to supplement with MCT oil and/or coconut oil.

And there is a prescription medical food called Axona, specifically for Alzheimer's, that is based on these diets....I think it was expensive compared to MCT or virgin coconut oil.

"Both my parents have/had suffered from dementia.   Mum had vascular dementia and passed away almost five years ago.  Dad has alzheimers and is now living in a nursing home.

I only gave this info so you will know I have some experience of dealing with these terrible conditions.

It seems to me that if he has asked you if you think he has alzheimers, he already has some concerns of his own but is unwilling, or unable, to face up to them.  Perfectly understandable, and my mother did the same thing.  Mum obviously had some concern but when the gp told her she didn't have alzheimers she clung to that and ""switched off"" when he continued on to tell her that she had vascular dementia.  Until the day she died, she had no idea she was suffering from dementia.  My father, to the best of my knowledge, also has no idea.  It's obviously not something I can bring up with him.

I really strongly recommend that as the first step you speak to your father's doctor.  Tell him/her what you have witnessed, and what your instinct tells you.  My father's gp only today told me to do what I instinctively feel is right for my father, difficult as that may be.

As others have said, if you don't already have it, try to organise for him to sign an Enduring Power of Attorney appointing you, and/or anybody else appropriate, to act on his behalf if the need arises.  Do this before it reaches the stage where someone outside the family may need to be appointed.

As my father's enduring power of attorney I have just today had to instruct his gp that my father is not to see any more doctors or specialists.  Dad has reached the stage where it is a case of palliative care only, and in a moment of lucidity yesterday he actually told me himself that he doesn't want to see any more doctors.  He's had enough.  Without that POA goodness knows what decisions would be made on my father's behalf, and who would be making them.

Contact some dementia support services/hotlines and speak to the advisers there.  They will be able to tell you what would be the best course of action for you to take.

I hope that if, as it seems, your Dad has dementia you are able to organise for his ongoing care as his condition progresses.

You have my very best wishes - I do know what a dreadfully difficult path you and your father are now on.   Above all else, and obviously once you are sure your father is being properly cared for, make sure you take care of yourself.  I have first-hand experience of the toll failing to do that can take.

"It is disgustingly scary to have that knowledge and ultimately it comes down to what kind of person you are. Some people feel much better knowing the future, even if it is sad, and some people don't want to know because they can't concentrate on living if they find out they are going to die much earlier than you might have thought. 

Whatever you decide, make sure you are well-informed! Talk to a doctor, or even better a genetic councelor (don't know the proper term in english, but a person specializing in genetic diseses), sometimes it can feel better to just have more information.

"I lost my grandmother in September of last year after seven years of caring for her while she suffered through Alzheimers. She was an amazing woman. She took me in when I was six years old and raised me until adulthood. I am now 37 and I still see her everywhere I look. 

I still live in the home in which I cared for her and some evening I can hear her calling me for a glass of water or to help her to the bathroom. Out of the corner of my eye sometimes I catch a flash of motion and for a moment think it is her making her way into the livingroom to stare out of the front windows. 

These things were disconcerting at first, but I now find comfort in them. in a small way it is as if she is still here with us. My wife, Three children and I have all mourned her loss greatly, it was truly devastating for all of us. Now though, I am entering a comfortable area in which I can look back and take joy and comfort from her memory rather than be reminded of my grief. This happens gradually but eventually you will get to that point. 

In the early days after her passing I took great comfort in writing her letters and preparing some of her recipes for my family. Perhaps you could try this.  

Just remember this. All of the things she taught you, the values and life lessons from her stories, those things were a part of her and now are a part of you. You carry with you her memory and that is the finest tribute anyone can give to a passed loved one. I know this is probably of no comfort now since your pain is still so present. but I assure you it will pass.

"I, and I'm sure many others here, feel you.  I've had similar situations with my (fairly young) grandma.  At 77, with Alzheimer's for about ten years, she's at a point where she can no longer properly verbalize what she wants to say.  At the beginning of the process it starts off as little things, maybe calling a cup a clown or running sentences together, but it is still understandable for the most part.  Now communication is almost impossible, but there was a point where conversation was just getting to the point where we couldn't quite understand her and vice versa. And I remember her getting frustrated and then sobbing.  She would begin apologizing, and I could tell she felt horrible for not being able to communicate with us.  She could go hours crying and saying sorry.  It's heartbreaking.  Sometimes you wish you could just get the point across that you're there for them and enjoy just being with them.  And regardless of how they start to act, whether they become catatonic, depressed, angry, or whatever, you need to keep reminding yourself deep down that you're doing the most you can by being with them.  And although Alzheimer's is a painful process, just by being there, overall you're making their final years just a little bit easier.  As she's started to forget who I am it's almost gotten easier for me in a way.  Her eyes no longer light up when she sees me, and maybe my old grandma's not ""there,"" but she's also more peaceful not having to live up to anyone's expectations of how she should be acting.

"I'm not the one to talk with if people play games with secrets. If your mother has her faculties and just chooses to ignore the issue, then I'd call your Dad out when he says and does inappropriate things. If they want to act like nothing is wrong, that's their choice. 

My Grandmother said some racist/inappropriate things to a stylist in a salon and I called her out on her behavior. She was embarrassed, but the diseased hadn't progressed to such a point that she didn't realize she was rude. She was also rude to me on several occasions and I literally just stopped the activity (shopping once, dinner another time) and told her I was returning home. It's a five hour trip I make weekly to see her.

She never did it again. I'm not her emotional punching bag and wouldn't put up with it at the early stages. 

Now in the last 6 weeks or so she is lost about who we are. She may be insistent about an activity, but she can be redirected.

http://www.agingcare.com/Articles/bad-behavior-by-elderly-parents-138673.htm

In my Grandmother's case, drugs helped immensely with the hallucinations, chronological tasks (socks go on before shoes) and ability to keep a train of thought.

She used to revert to a period 40 years earlier and think some of her children weren't home yet and would call to them from the back porch. As soon as we got the drugs right, that stopped. She was also able to mostly appropriately participate in activities like lunch out with family, shopping at the grocery or for clothes. 

Unfortunately or fortunately, your parents aren't children and as long as your Mother chooses to act like nothing's wrong, then let her deal with it. There were signs with my Grandmother, but because I wasn't living in the country at the time, I didn't see them and my Mother chose to ignore or minimize them. It wasn't until I was asked to stay with my Grandmother for a week when I returned that I realized how bad things had become and I pushed the issue for medication, caregivers, etc.. 

This is a very individual journey into elderly personhood. Some issues may be dementia, there may be a physical issue like a urinary tract infection that is vastly different for the elderly than a younger person.

&gt;__Anosognosia__ (/æˌnɒsɒɡˈnoʊziə/, /æˌnɒsɒɡˈnoʊʒə/; from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek) ἀ- *a-*, ""without"", νόσος *nosos*, ""disease"" and γνῶσις *gnōsis*, ""knowledge"") is viewed as a deficit of self-awareness, a condition in which a person who suffers certain [disability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability) seems unaware of the existence of his or her disability. It was first named by the [neurologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurologist) [Joseph Babinski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Babinski) in 1914.  Anosognosia results from physiological damage on brain structures, typically to the parietal lobe or a diffuse lesion on the fronto-temporal-parietal area in the right hemisphere.    Whilst this distinguishes the condition from [denial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial), which is a psychological [defense mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_mechanism), attempts have been made at a unified explanation.  Both anosognosia and [denial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial) are almost always connected with damage in the right hemisphere. [Split-brain research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_brain_interpreter) suggests that this asymmetry points to a neurological answer.  Anosognosia is sometimes accompanied by asomatognosia, a form of neglect in which patients deny ownership of their limbs.

"Thank you.  

She's allowed to have the cat where she's living now, but there are no pets allowed in AL.

A private caregiver is an option, but we already tried that.  The lady the agency sent was very nice and had a wonderful 3 hour visit with my mom but when she came back two days later my mom refused to let her in.  Then, later, she had no recollection that she'd ever talked to/met a caregiver.

On a bad day she is, in many ways, like a giant two year old.  She lashes out, yells, responds irrationally, and makes threats (when she's thwarted her favorite is ""Well I'll just get a gun and kill myself.""  No means for her to do that, and no intent to actually do it -- just the worst thing she can think of to say).  She reacts very badly whenever we bring the subject up.

"My grandfather does this too. He stays pissed right up to the point where we get to steak n shake and he gets his chocolate milkshake.  Then its smooth sailing.  They don't stay mad long, so keep that in mind when he gets indignant. And as far as getting up and ""going home"", I always like to take him on a walk when he does that. We talk, he tells me the same stories, calls me by my uncle's name, we come back in, I tell him I love him (sometimes I'll even call him dad if he's insistent) and he's good to go.  I call it restless brain syndrome (like restless leg syndrome, but for your noggin), and it only g oes away when he's properly stimulated.  No one ever said it was easy to be a caretaker, but I have had moments with that man that I will never forget and I wouldn't trade them for the world.

"Professionals (the center staff, her doctor) tend to gravitate toward what's easy. But with your mom's attachment to her cat, her gardening, her possessions, her dinner-mates, etc., I'd hold off on AL and give the in-home caregiver another shot. One 3-hour visit is nowhere near enough to evaluate how your mom might eventually take to someone coming in on a regular basis. Maybe you can work out a schedule where the person comes in every day, or even a couple of times a day, at the same time. People with dementia do better with fixed routines. A good caregiver will also become familiar with your mom's neighbors, too, so your mom may start to see the caregiver as a part of her community.

"I am so sorry to hear that you have an increased chance. It's great that you have to opportunity to test. I would like to suggest that you apply for long term stay insurance BEFORE testing.  I have included the aarp article on how to choose one. Too many people discover they need it when they can't get it. It pays for assisted living (US average is over 4,000.00 per month and normally higher for AD ward) I didn't realize that Medicare and supplemental insurance did not cover any portion of these services until my SO needed them. The younger you are when you sign up the cheaper the rates, and to be honest having AD in your family history might alarm them to begin with. Once you have a positive genetic test on file, it will be cost prohibitive for you to get long term stay insurance and can even effect the cost of your life insurance premiums

"When my mother got to this point (asked me 4 times in 15 minutes ""what's this thing?"", a kitchen sink faucet adapter I'd gotten her), she also was in denial.  My later reading indicated that this complete lack of concern is pretty much characteristic of some dementias.

I think if you're going to have any impact, you're going to have to adopt a very different mindset than you've probably had previously about your dad.  When we're dealing with grown men and women, our mindset, and our interactions, are founded on respect for their autonomy, respect for their ability to evaluate and decide for themselves what's best.

But with dementia, their ability to evaluate and decide for themselves is no longer reliable.  They function more and more like a child - And with children, we know perfectly well that to unilaterally respect their ability to evaluate and decide for themselves is not at all the best thing for them.  Instead, we do our best to let the kids make age appropriate decisions for themselves.  For other decisions we use a variety of techniques to both protect our kids from disasterous decisions, and to help them work their way towards better decisions.

It's the same now with your dad.  You have to start treating him like a child.  What's appropriate now is an approach that would have been unthinkable in the past - Manipulate, cajole, get stern, distract, bribe, use every trick in the book to get your way (I'm kind of exaggerating, but hopefully you get what I'm trying to convey).  He doesn't want to go to the dr.  But he must.  Maybe not this week, maybe not this month, but eventually...

I always imagine people have a (quite natural) reluctance to start treating their parents like this.  I didn't seem to - It came fairly natural to interact with what was actually there.  And I don't mean that any of this should be done in a mean, nasty way.  It's quite possible to be firm, immutable, stern, without being vicious about it.

TL;DR - You approached the situation directly, he rebuffed you directly, now you feel stuck.  The answer is to be indirect, to ignore his decision to not go to the Dr., and to keep working on him (nag him, jolly him along, read him the riot act, whatever) till you wear him down and get him to go.  It may take days or weeks, keep at it for as long as it takes.

Started by leaving the stove on, staring at an open refrigerator, opening every cabinet multiple times and looking, putting the floor cleaner in the fridge (next to the box of uncooked spaghetti).  She is hungry (seemingly) all the time.  She has eaten raw vegetables that really should be cooked.  She has eaten a bowl of grilled onions (was supposed to be a side for chicken/tacos).  She covered her plate with hot sauce (thinking it was ketchup?) when our back was turned for a second - didn't say a word but her eyes watered for the whole meal.  Food is very confusing for her.  One of her favorite foods is fish - and every time she eats it she asks what it is, where it came from - as if she is tasting it for the first time.  When she was first diagnosed I assumed it would be like a regression - like memory tapes just erasing backwards.  Its nothing like that.  She doesn't remember family friends that have been in her life for 20 years, but remembers me and my kids.  She gets confused by surroundings that she has lived in her whole life, but loves to travel/ride in the car.

A friend casually mentioned he thought Alzheimer's would be a decent way to die - as your awareness would slowly slip away.  I told him it was the opposite.  You are aware, but you don't understand anything.  My MIL is usually panicked, confused, so she over-compensates and trusts strangers to tell her where she is or where to go.  At times she is confused by people speaking her native language, so she thinks they are speaking something else.  She doesn't know what any of the foods are - how to cook - what is food and what isn't.  

It is like having terminal cancer or losing a child and waking up and not remembering your pain/loss - for that first few instants of eyes open - and then you remember that something happened but can't remember what.  You know you have something important today, but can't remember what.  You go to your kitchen and nothing is where its supposed to be, and you can't remember what you thought you were going to have for breakfast.  Nothing looks good, it all looks *foreign.*  People look familiar, but strange at the same time.  Like you had a fight about something and you don't remember the details.

"I suggest you look at the #2 and #3 links I had given: Melatonin REVERSES the profilbrillogenic acitivity of apoliprotein e4 on the alzheimer amyloid a peptide.

I am not SENSATIONALIZING science, there is a wealth of information out there that is PURPOSELY being suppressed by popular media and on internet Alzheimer's forums. 

For the last 30 years, people have known that melatonin depletion directly causes Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Numerous studies corroborated that NIACINACIDE is important for the synthesis of MELATONIN in the body, and that when given this vitamin, people had a less risk for Alzheimer's. There also also studies of L-Tryptophan, the precursor to MELATONIN as also REVERSING Alzheimer's, however L-Tryptophan was banned by the FDA in 1989 right before Prozac was put on the market to sell depression meds. L-Trytophan is the precursor for MELATONIN production and is back on the market today. 

Alzheimer's patients have the following in common: Niacin depletion and, tryptophan and melatonin depletion. 

Thanks to current SSRI antidepressants, high blood pressure meds, beta blockers, cholesterol lowering drugs- these drugs ALL contribute to people developing Alzheimer's later in life. In places like Africa, there is hardly any incidence of ALZHEIMER'S because they don't take these pharmaceuticals that later DIRECTLY CAUSE this condition. 

This is great for the pharmaceutical companies that develop lifelong patients/clients, but if you have a loved one who suffers from Alzheimer's then MELATONIN supplementation can only help him and her.

"I have a 93 year old grandmother with advanced AD and my 70 year old mother is definitely having issues.

My grandmother never smoked, had a college degree back in the 30's, ate right, exercised, did the NYT crossword in pen and seemingly did everything you were supposed to but now at 93 she's in great health, but she can't remember how put on her own shoes.

I don't know that there is anything to do. All the things we were told about the anti-oxidants Vitamin e, etc were debunked by the 90+ study.  Ginkgo leaf may help with Alzheimer's symptoms, but the studies are not widely accepted because there are multiple studies that contradict this.

I think we live with what we have and then decide what to do when and if the disease arrives.

Alzheimer's isn't an absentmindedness (like forgetting where you put your keys) - its about losing things most people take for granted - like keys don't go in the microwave, take your clothes off before you shower, what does hungry feel like....
