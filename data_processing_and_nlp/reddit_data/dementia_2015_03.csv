"I so don't want to put a damper on your mom's optimism, and I'm by no means a doctor, so all I can offer you is my own experience.
Dementia also runs in my family, and my father (70) began to decline a little over a year ago. We couldn't get a definite diagnosis (most signs now seem to point to vascular dementia), but my sister and I were heartened by articles we found on sleep apnea symptoms being mistaken for what we saw as a more ""incurable"" dementia.
One big problem was getting my dad to actually wear the CPAP mask (they can be uncomfortable, so shop around for what works best). He lived alone at the time so there was no one to remind him, which might be different in your case. There are alternative sleep apnea treatments that might be worth exploring if he struggles with the CPAP.

"About a month ago my mother got a call from the police in a town four hours away. My grandfather had just gotten in his truck and drove until he ran out of gas. At this point my grandparents were not living right next to us as they are now, but a few towns over. 

Basically my mom went and got him and when she called my grandmother, my grandmother told her she was sick with the flu and exhausted and she couldn't possibly take care of him. She didn't have him on any meds and he was out of control. She begged my mother to put him in a facility, ""so he can't hurt anyone"". She flat out told my mother that she was so exhausted, physically and emotionally, that she couldn't deal with him.

My mother went through a lot of effort to get him into a facility. Then, my grandmother moved into town and went on a rampage to get him out. She swore up and down she doesn't remember telling my mother to put him in a facility, that she was just on medication and wasn't thinking straight. She berated my mother for ""not knowing her and not realizing there was something wrong with her"", that she would ""never abandon her husband"". (We've since come to the conclusion that she is lying about not remembering, based on some other things she has said.) And she took him out of the facility and into their new home here in the town I live in.

My grandmother refuses to do anything that anyone recommends to her. I don't know if she is consciously doing it or what, but it's almost out of spite, like ""how dare we tell her what to do"". 

No, the assisted living facilities around here aren't GREAT. But he was fine. They don't make enough money for the great ones, but make too much for insurance to pay for one. My mother even said she would take early retirement and become his caregiver. But no, that was unacceptable too. 

My grandmother has always had this complex where she needs to show her strength, but she always plays up the victim aspect. Like, ""Oooh poor me, the hardship that has befallen me, and NO ONE is willing to help me so I've just got to do it all myself!"" It's infuriating and childish. My mother has basically told her she is being an idiot and says she doesn't even want anything to do with her, but that she will help her father if HE needs help. 

We all basically don't know what to do. I'm just trying to help where I can. I was pretty sure these violent episodes WERE NOT normal, I just wanted confirmation.

Last night he was completely normal though. I sat with him and he just told me about how he had a hard day because ""his brain doesn't want to work right"" and I just told him he needed to sleep more, and he was fine with that. This morning he was fine. But the night before last he absolutely told me he wanted to kill my grandmother. It's nerve wracking. 

I fully believe that what will happen is he will have another physically violent episode and she will be forced to accept she cannot handle him. I just really worry about the extent of that episode.

"Two years ago, my wife's parents were both deemed unfit to be alone. Her mother was diagnosed with alzheimers and her father with vascular dementia caused by mini strokes. We immediately moved in with the two of them with our young daughter. I had a full time job getting me out of the house everyday but my wife found herself running a full care nursing home on her own. She showed strength and resolve which i never new she had. We found it very difficult getting help from the powers that be and had to learn a lot as we went.
As everyone so fat has said. Lie. Or just don't bring it up. It sounds selfish but trust me, not only does it make it easier on you but its by far kinder than breaking their heart every day by telling them the truth that they wont remember. 
We were told that as long as they were both otherwise healthy and safe, they were staying put with us. Her mother was extremely aggressive and believed we were conspiring to poison her and her husband so we could take the house. There were many confrontations. She would become livid and then forget why. Then with great concern say that her heart was racing and she felt light headed. On one occasion we convinced her that an EMT should look at her who convinced her that maybe an overnight in the hospital for observation would be a good thing. We knew that the best thing for all would be for her to stay and so my wife refused to take her
home. It was the only way to get the system to pay attention to our situation. Her mother stayed in that hospital room for 3 months while a bed was found in a nearby facility. The family visited everyday and assured her that she was only there for the night for some tests. The whole family lied for 3 months and said she was only there for the night and she was fine with that. 
My wife's father was a little more accepting of what was happening to him and his wife and he stayed with us for another year before we got him a bed in the best facility in the province. His wife moved into the same facility two days before hand and after not seeing her for a year, he was happier than i had seen him in a while. He was on the list for a long while and we knew it was the best thing for him. We accepted it and had a few conversations with him where he knew it was what was needed. But when the phone call came telling us that he had a bed it was a punch to the gut. We all felt like the worst people in the world.  You will too. Just remember that it is better for them and you this way

TLDR: Lie, say what ever needs to be said so that the moments that your loved ones have are the calmest they can be. Because that's all that most of them have now, moments.

He explained that the ""being mean"" and the shouting (she used to stand in front of the mirror and rail at her own reflection) is part of the morbid personality. As he explained it, we all have a morbid part of our personality but society teaches us to keep it it check, and that ability to do so regresses as the disease progresses.
