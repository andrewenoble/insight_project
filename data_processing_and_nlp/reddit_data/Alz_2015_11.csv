"The familial genetic mutations are rare and are only found in a few families with mutations in genes called APP or Presenilin. These special cases belong to a separate class of Alzheimer's called ""Familial Alzheimer's"". Most people who develop Alzheimer's do not come from these families, so Alzheimer's is not considered hereditary. 

Alzheimer's, like most chronic diseases, involves ""risk factors"". Risk factors can be genetic or environmental. If you have a genetic risk factor, like a mutation in the TREM2 gene, you are more likely to develop Alzheimer's, but only by a few precentage points. Environmental risk factors also play a huge role. Factors like obesity and poor oral hygiene, combined with genetic susceptibility make someone more likely to develop the disease. Look at Figure 2 in the link below for a little more information.

I work with residents in the severest stages of Alzheimer's disease. One thing that might help you is to set your grandmother up with her own personal iPod. You can give her a playlist of songs that are meaningful to her and that are calming as well. Music can help reduce anxiety in individuals with dementia and it could be a way for you to bond with her a few hours before she usually goes to bed (I wouldn't do it immediately before sleep but maybe play around with the timing...). Perhaps after listening to music and dancing a little bit her brain will have been stimulated enough for it to calm down later when she needs to sleep. One thing to be aware of is that older people in general wake up earlier so it could be that 7AM is a natural time for her to be up and the Alzheimer's disease simply makes it hard and confusing. You could try the iPod in the morning or you could see if you can adjust you schedule to go to bed earlier. The music is definitely worth a try. I wish you and your grandmother the best.,,,,timandericscat,,,1448649102,t5_2r8fp,t3_3t7aoz,t3_3t7aoz,1,1450054307,0,0,cxewx5w,Alzheimers,1,,

"My apologies if I misrepresented your comments. I agree that amyloid is not a clinically validated drug target. However, given the same validation criteria, peroxynitrite scavengers are also not clinically validated. Your references show that diet, aromatherapy, and ginseng are effective in small human studies, but please know that amyloid therapies were also effective in similar small human studies. Unfortunately, therapeutic benefit from amyloid therapies were not reproducible in large human studies.

Also, no Tau-targeted large human studies have been completed. Therefore, your claim that Tau tangles “are not harmful” is unvalidated, incredibly simplistic, and misleading. 

Many Alzheimer’s experts agree than anti-inflammatory and alternative therapies need to be explored, and many of these strategies have been pursued. However, every attempt using anti-inflammatories and antioxidants have failed. Fortunately, dozens of studies exploring new drug targets are ongoing and are listed in the link below. I also completely agree that diet is an important risk factor in Alzheimer’s development. I just strongly disagree with calling any research a “myth” when clinical studies have not been completed.

"When dealing with someone with AD it is best to throw logic out the window. It may seem simple and logical to you (writing the notes, expecting her to understand that you are there but asleep, etc) but it doesn't mean anything to her.

That was a great suggestion of inviting her to share your bed for a while - it might make her feel more secure.

The diversion tactics often work but I'm guessing that they won't here since she is wanting the security of you.

Best of luck with your dad. My advice, tell them you love him every day. Filter out the bad and remember the good.  Take pictures.  Enjoy your time with him.

"My mother and sister both have AD and are incredibly similar in their symptoms. About 4 years ago I started my mom on CO and for a while her symptoms seemed to have less of a negative impact on her than on my sister who was on similar meds but not CO. But, it did not seem to halt the inexorable march of the disease towards new symptoms, which seemed to hit both my mom and sister at the same time. 

So, I can't say one way or the other, unfortunately. 

Reasons I think it did make it easier for my mom as opposed to my sister who did not take it, are based on my own model of AD and I'd be run out of reddit if I started to espouse them here: There are so few good models of the mechanics of AD, that anything you try and think works, will be poo poo'ed from ""where's your proof you gullible fool!"" brigade.

But I think the worst part for me is just getting flashes in the midst of my day, thinking about her suffering, what her existence must be like.

"Much of this is well-stated and correct, but let me add some nuance.

Nitrated tau tangles are a problem in Alzheimer's disease because they inhibit neurotransmisssions and the transport of nutrients.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3704193/

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15848182

The problem is not hyperphosphorylation, however, but nitration.  Moreover nitration causes additional problems in Alzheimer's disease including inhibiting the neuroprotective phosphatidyinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway.  The result is restricted blood flow in the brain and little to no neuron regeneration in the hippocampus.

Peroxynitrite and hydrogen peroxide scavengers both inhibit and partially reverse tyrosine nitration by producing water.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10630617

They also partially reverse oxidation by donating hydrogen atoms.  And it is likely oxidation and nitration that causes most of the damage to the brain in Alzheimer's disease.

Some antioxidants have failed in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: some are weak antioxidants, some become pro-oxidants under certain conditions, and some are excellent antioxidants but not readily absorbed either into the bloodstream or into the fatty tissue of the brain.

Certain antioxidants have succeeded in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.  These include eugenol in rosemary essential oil via aromatherapy and ferulic acid, syringic acid, vanillin, p-coumaric acid, and maltol in panax ginseng.   Eugenol has to pass through only a limited blood-brain barrier and the combination of ferulic acid (which has improved behavior but not cognition in various forms of dementia) with other antioxidants has improved cognition in small-scale clinical trials with Alzheimer's disease.

I agree that small-scale clinical trials (especially those not well-controlled) is insufficient evidence that these compounds can be used to treat Alzheimer's disease.  But if you have the pathways, the mechanism, and initial positive results there is no excuse for not testing these compounds on a larger-scale.

"Yes. My mother has AD and is pretty far advanced, and just before her dementia hallucinations and paranoia got really bad, I thought I'd get her a small lapdog she could croon over and love and sleep with and feed and fuss and so on. 

Not a good idea, because within months after I got such a dog her real dementia related hallucinations and paranoia-related violence started, and her favourite hallucination was that someone is killing ""the baby"" and she has to ""save the baby"" even if she rips every picture off the wall, every curtain down, smashes the glass of the windows or me if I tried to stop her. And, of course the small dog was the embodiment of ""the baby"" and the dog started to nip her quite seriously to escape her clutches before it was squeezed to death. 

So, Ive had to take over the dog.

Situation now is she still has hallucinations and paranoia, but the new meds she is on seem to have knocked the stuffing out of her, and made her too weak for her violent episodes, and what we have is her treating me as if I want to kill her and ""the baby"" that I have to keep away from her.

"Alzheimer's is not clearly an amyloid based disease.  The amyloidist have shifted the goal post from plaques to oligomers but have not shown or proven what damage oligomers do to the brain. One possibility is that they increase levels of hydrogen peroxide, but the decline in hydrogen peroxide levels as the disease progresses is perhaps the best evidence that most oligomers are converted into plaques as the disease progresses.

Hydrogen peroxide is generated during the very early stages of aggregation of the amyloid peptides implicated in Alzheimer disease and familial British dementia.

Ultrastructural studies with both peptides revealed that structures resembling ""soluble oligomers"" or ""protofibrils"" were present during this early phase of hydrogen peroxide formation. Mature amyloid fibrils derived from Abeta-(1-40) did not generate hydrogen peroxide. We conclude that hydrogen peroxide formation during the early stages of protein aggregation may be a common mechanism of cell death in these (and possibly other) neurodegenerative diseases.

There have been many attempts to use anti-amyloid antibodies to treat Alzheimer's disease and to date all have failed.  Amyloidist keep trying to change the goal post: the antibody did not remove enough amyloid, it targeted the wrong form of amyloid (plaques instead of oligomers), and it was not given early enough.  But as further trials are done, none of this appears to explain the failure of the amyloid approach.

The problem is that numerous repeatable studies have not been done on particularly antioxidants even when in several cases these antioxidants have shown effectiveness in small-scale clinical trials.
