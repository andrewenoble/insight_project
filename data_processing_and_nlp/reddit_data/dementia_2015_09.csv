As the dementia progresses, some things get easier.  You'll be able to  control his access to food with simple child proofing, once he gets to the point where he can't figure such things out anymore.  You'll be able to keep him on prescribed meds once he gets to the point where you (or his wife) simply hand him his doses with a glass of water.

There are stages to the whole thing, and at each stage, some of the challenges of the previous stage melt away.

My mom, too, was convinced there was nothing wrong that couldn't be explained by simple aging. I guess that's probably pretty typical - combination of fearing, avoiding ""the worst"", and not remembering, in the first place, all the things they forget!

Edit:

I do understand the desire to minimize the number of meds he's taking.  But...  From your original post:

&gt; He's so easily angered and doesn't want to do anything, how can I get him to enjoy anything anymore?

"You or someone in your family need to have a talk with his doctor. Tell the doctor every thing that had been going on and for how long. There is a simple memory test his doctor can do. Dad can't lie about a series of numbers that he has to recite back to the doctor. Either he can or he can't.

It is way past time to get him on some medication, and for your family to lay down some rules for dad, 24 hour Depends being the first.

You should look into getting Power of Attorney of him. That way you have control of his bank account (sorry side chick) and medical care.

That side girl needs to go. All of you need to sit her down (without dad present) and tell her she is not welcome around anymore and to not contact him. Get a restraining order if you have to.

"OK. I can relate to this. Your grandpa could be my FIL.

First off, there is a great episode on This American Life about this. The man's mother-in-law developed dementia and he utilized his improv skills to go along with her hallucinations and confabulations.

The worst thing you can do is try to correct him and bring him around to your reality. It only causes more confusion and distress. This is really hard for some people, because it requires stepping out of denial about the fact that their loved one is not in the same reality and never will be, again.

Instead of arguing with him, just go along with his stories. A lot of head shaking and saying ""Ahhh. OK. Sure"" is required. Treat him with respect, and not like a child. Comfort him when he is afraid. My FIL had a scenario where he had been trapped out in the desert for days, without food or water. I would feign alarm and tell him that I was sending a rescue team to get him back to civilization. When he talked about getting back to work, I'd redirect him by asking questions about things he had done in the past. He would talk about things he did when he was successful and that seemed to pacify him.

You may feel as though it's dishonest, but he cannot comprehend the truth and being forced to try only results in upset.

"There are a several types of dementia, and some can cause ""inappropriate"", unfiltered behavior, because they do their damage in the parts of the brain that give us our ability to make good decisions.

Talk to his dr., describe all this.  In the ordinary course of events, drs can't talk about patients, but in this case, if I were you, my approach would be to ask for direction to resources for ascertaining whether he's reached a point where he'd be considered not competent to be in charge of his own affairs.

Regarding power of attorney, as mentioned by darthjenni, couple of thoughts - One is that unless he's legally declared not competent, getting a power of attorney is entirely dependent on his willingness to do it.  On the one hand, he doesn't sound willing to do it.  On the other hand, the personal filth, inability to recognize the seriousness of his medical issues, and downright dangerous cooking issues (both spoiled food and leaving burners on) seem to me to be to put him very close to, if not already solidly within the bounds that would support a legal declaration of incompetence.

Maybe contact [http://www.alz.org/](http://www.alz.org/), asking for local legal resources that can help you bet informed on how things like that work in your county.

Also, googling is another avenue you can use to find helpful resources in your county.  Try something like ""senior assistance"".  If your search doesn't turn up any orgs that seem spot on for your particular situation, call them anyway - Even if they aren't set up to help with your dad, they'll most likely be able to give you phone numbers of other local orgs that would be more appropriate.

One more bit of power of attorney related info - Learned this when my mom what on the downward slide - A regular Power of Attorney becomes null and void if the person who conveyed it to you becomes incapacitated, which makes it pretty much useless for these situations.  This may be on a county by county basis, which is why you have to do the research for your own county, but where we were, what was needed was a Durable Power of Attorney.

"Could be he doesn't want to do the driving eval because he suspects/fears/knows in his heart of hearts that he would fail it.

An anti-depressant could be a very helpful step.

My mom had alzheimer's.  Originally she was put on prozac because her dr. thought it possible that her memory problems came from undiagnosed depression.  (She was very dismissive of that idea, to the point where she utterly refused to even give it a try.  So my sister told her ""These are your memory pills"", and just brought her the day's dose every day.)

A couple or so years later, when it was crystal clear that depression was not the problem, my sister took her off the prozac for a while.  My mom got quite a lot more difficult, moody, obstinate, bad-tempered, so my sister started her back on the prozac.

So, from my experience, an anti-depressant for a person with dementia can be helpful in ways over and above what we usually expect to gain from taking anti-depressants. 

It's also important for him to have ""something to do"".  You say he can't do the things he used to enjoy.  And it can be challenging to think up, out of thin air so to speak, interesting hobbies for someone else.  

I'd suggest contacting the geriatric center where he was diagnosed, ask them for local and online resources for caregivers.

These kinds of resources will have suggestions you'd never have thought of on your own, plus just getting connected with other people's ideas will probably give a boost to your own abilities to come up with ideas for addressing these problems.

"My Granny is in late stages of Dementia.  I'm not her primary caregiver,  my Mom is,  but distraction can be a great tool.  Usually if she wants to go for a walk or do something we're not able to accompany her with at the moment we can distract her long enough that she forgets.  Usually I'll say something like ""I'd love to go for a walk,  we'll go in a few minutes,  but first can you do me a favor?""  I give her a small task like wipe the counter,  or rinse out a glass or any simple task that's in the same room and I know she can complete.  If it's something too complicated she gets frustrated or aggravated.  I think she struggles with not feeling useful so when I tell her how much the task helps me out and how much I appreciate it she just beams.  

Also when she gets agitated and starts pacing or ransacking things,  sometimes if I just stop a second and ask for a hug she calms down immediately.  Something about a kind touch like a hug or holding her hand for a minute changes her disposition immediately.

With your brother, I would do the same. Cameras are a pretty fool proof monitor, as are recording devices.

"Does your mother have a diagnosis from a doctor? Is she on any medication for Alzheimer disease? Does the doctor know about her distress? The doctor may be able to add to her medication something that will calm her.

Try contacting the [Alzheimer Association](http://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_what_is_alzheimers.asp) for information. Maybe they have a chapter in your area. Perhaps their [Message Boards](https://www.alzconnected.org/) where you can talk to other caregivers might be of some help and comfort to you.

Can your mother still read? Get your dad to write a (large) message that tells her not to worry, that he will be home at whatever time, and show that to her when she gets upset (you may have to show it to her multiple times, but that's normal) or maybe you can get him to record a similar message on your phone or computer to play for her, or maybe do both. Draw a picture of a clock showing the time she can expect him and point out that it's not that time yet, but he will be home eventually.

You're rightâ€”there is not much to be happy about while your mother goes through the various stages of the disease, but *you* have a life, too, and you should not deny yourself the opportunity to socialize with your friends when you can. 

I am so sorry you have to deal with this, but it will be over someday, and then you can be proud that you were part of her welfare team, that you cared for her when she was helpless, just as she once cared for you when you were.",,,,sadatay,,,1442453480,t5_2rfqf,t3_3l6fa7,t3_3l6fa7,1,1444407548,0,0,cv47n3r,dementia,1,,

"&gt;  I'm really lost on what to do.

Trigger warning: This is going to be blunt. It's not meant to be cruel, it's meant to be a wake up call.


Looking through your post history suggests it's time to grow up and learn responsibility.

Your OKCupid profile says you didn't do a bunch of things when you were younger because you took care of your grandmother when she died. If that were true, you'd know how to take care of your father. Maybe you didn't do a bunch of things because you avoided doing things that made you uncomfortable.

Right now it seems you cannot take care of yourself enough to own &amp; operate a vehicle. You blame your parents because you cannot drive. Maybe driving or going to work made you uncomfortable.

You overeat. Maybe exercise makes you uncomfortable.

You're wrapped up in comic books. Maybe the real world makes you uncomfortable.

Well, it's time to wake up and pour yourself a huge cup of uncomfortable: your father is in deep depression due to isolation and feelings of worthlessness brought on by unemployment. 

&gt; Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Consider the possibility it's time *you* start helping *others*.

&gt; I've called him 15 times today and he hasn't answered the phone.

And you get on reddit? 

Step one: If you cannot reach him by phone RIGHT THIS MINUTE then CALL THE POLICE IMMEDIATELY TO PERFORM A WELFARE CHECK.
