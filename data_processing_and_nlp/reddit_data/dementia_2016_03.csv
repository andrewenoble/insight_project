"First of all, I am so sorry for the situation you have been given.  My dad has dementia and we recently found a place for him nearby but it is pretty expensive.  Is there any savings or anything that she personally has or is there any money available for a care facility?  If so, I've used www.caring.com andA Place for Mom to find facilities. You will need to look at ""memory care"" or alzheimer's facilities and ask for those that have locked doors or alarms that go off when doors are opened.  They should be able to help you find something even if there isn't much money available.  I think there may be state funded nursing homes (?) but I am not sure.  Overall, i think I liked caring.com better in terms of customer service.  They seemed more genuine and they didn't constantly call me and bug me.  There will be some of that of course...
Have you asked the day care facility if they know any place?  Being local, they might have a better idea of good places.  
My dad is at a place that is a national chain, called Brookdale.  It is pretty good and cheaper than a few others that are supposed to be good but its still a lot of money.  I don't know how memory care works everywhere but make sure the price is all inclusive.  If its a place that charges by how much they have to do to help your grandmother then beware and be careful.  (For ADLs or Activities of Daily Living). It should be a place that can do everything she might need and not charge more or less.  I don't know how nursing homes differ from memory care.  I know that insurance generally won't cover much.  
I was hoping to have my dad live with my family but just staying here for a week before he moved to the facility showed me that it was impossible.  I can't believe you have been saddled with her care while going to school.  

If it is too expensive to put her in a care facility, maybe you can look into hiring a caregiver for when she isn't at the day care facility?  I don't know what the major companies charge (like Home Instead) but you can ask at the day care to see if they know any reliable and honest smaller businesses that do care giver services.  When my mom had hip surgery and needed temporary help, she hired someone that was recommended by the other retirees in her community.  It was just a lady who is an RN and had some people who worked for her.  I couldn't tell how above board it was but they were honest workers.  Caring.com can probably help you with that too.

I wish you luck!  Please try to talk to someone in the meantime - councilor at school?  Breath.  And find something that takes the edge off like listen to music with a headphone in one ear while dealing with her. 
Oh!  Also, some senior centers give away food to seniors.  You might be able to collect some for her.  Some churches have senior programs too.  Our local Methodist church has meals during the week and I think they may also hand out food but not sure.  They also have an alzheimers support group but that involves you having time to go - so not sure that will help, but perhaps you could go once to ask if anyone knows of a facility??

"Hey there, I just began searching for people's experiences with this in MA. My grandmother is in her 70's and is becoming increasingly difficult to manage. Losing, misplacing belongings, repeated questions and forgetfulness isn't much more than a nuisance however she's very aggressive. My grandfather has been her rock and we're a very small family and so we're all involved in one another's daily lives and I can see how much his efforts in keeping her calm is taking a toll on him. Most of the time I feel like this'll end up getting to him before her. She was always in tip top shape, health conscious, physically active and brighter than anyone I've known but this has definitely turned her into a different and angrier person. Most medications that her doctor has prescribed haven't worked - she'll get nauseous, dizzy, and puts her even more out of her mind. I'm hoping marijuana can be somewhat of a solution since it's a natural substance (quite frankly, the lady was always opposed to even advils/tylenols so I'm not surprised the medicine hits her hard). Have you begun the process of making marijuana part of her daily regimen? Have you found it difficult to persuade her doctor? I'll make sure to talk to her doctor this week and ask about it but personal stories always give a better and well rounded scenario.

That's exactly right. Up until now we have been criticizing him quite a bit. It will stop now. However it hasn't been easy to understand because in most situations he is still the same person as always and then sometimes he just says the strangest things, or he fails to do the most obvious and easy stuff... 

I think you are right about using trickery to get him to the doctor. We need to think of a clever way to make him feel comfortable enough to do the testing.

"My wife had dementia in her late 50s. The diagnosis was FTD. as you'll be aware alzheimers is the most common form of dementia. I think vascular is 2nd. 
Many forms start with personality changes. I think the inability to form new memories is typical of alzheimers. 
Early stages are often very difficult. for the sake of discussion I will assume that your father has dementia. Sounds like it but could be lots of things including brain tumour, stroke, bleed, head injury, psychiatric condition. That's one reason you or your mother or both gotta go with him to see the doctor. To eliminate various causes. 
I say it's hard because early diagnosis is hard, can't really know for sure plus I found family doctors aren't very knowledgeable about dementia and are reluctant to diagnose it. Plus it's often hard or impossible to get the person to a doctor or neurologist or psychiatrist or geriatrician Etc. Then the person often masks symptoms for doc visit and is on good behaviour and will deny what you say. Can fool doctors and other people. Very frustrating. Write down notes of his behaviours with dates etc and give to doc. 
My wife was fastidious and immaculately presented. Went to wearing the same unattractive clothes and refusing to shower. Became childlike. No motivation. Lost her adult self. She died 6 years after diagnosis.  ",,,,Larsent,,,1458380430,t5_2rfqf,t3_46yjv6,t3_46yjv6,1,1460743737,0,0,d15jjvb,dementia,1,,
"Possibly putting her back in her old space would help, but you need to mitigate the fall risk before moving her. I ended up putting baby gates up around the house to keep grandma from getting into certain areas. Personally I'm a big fan of child-proofing just about anything I can just so I can sleep better at night. If your mom is a major fall risk, bed rails may eventually be needed. I put a plug in door bell with the button taped to the bedrails in case she needed something. It was both a blessing and a curse for a while, until she got so bad she didn't know what the button was. Gram got so bad about getting out of bed on her own when she wasn't supposed to, I even put a baby monitor in her room just in case. I'm not saying that is ideal for everyone, but risk assessment and management is big part of caregiving.

"I remember your previous post. Did you look into state funded nursing homes. They can only charge the income the person has. Your local Alz. Asso. or your counties Council on Aging should be able to help you (I mean your mother) find a facility. Your Grandma needs to be in a facility. You should not be taking care of your grandma. I realize your mom is tired and stressed also, but if she cannot get dinner fix before 9 pm when she has a mother with Alz. waiting to be fed, she does not need to be taking care of your grandma either.

First, your mother should be trying to get your grandma into a facility with a little help from you. Not the other way around. Second, if your mother makes excuses not to put your grandma into a facility, puts it off, or tries to put this responsibility totally on you....well I'm probably overstepping when I say this but, if I were you, I would flat out tell your mother that you would not be available anymore in the afternoon's to take care of your grandma. Period. Come up with a good excuse like I will be studying at the Library or with friends or a study group or whatever you can come up with. I would stick to my guns no matter how guilty she tries to make you feel. I would make sure I was not at home during those hours anymore. This will force your mother to do something about your grandmother. Right now she does not have to because she has you. The only other thing I can think of would be for you to get a part time job and move into an apartment with other roommates. I know you are young, and putting your foot down and sticking to your guns, no matter what (like guilt and religious jargon), and making big moves can be scary, but if your mother does not change this situation, you need to find a way out. You are to young for this. You need to get your education. 

One other thing, go talk to a counselor at school. Pour your heart out. Let the counselor see how stressed you are and how destructive this situation is for you. Maybe they will be able to help you convenience your mother that this is a very bad situation for you to be in.

I'm surprised the day care has not said something about your grandma's behavior and hygiene.

It's frustrating, but shit imagine what they are going through, fuck they are tortured every second with a disease they can't comprehend cause it's eating their fucking brain.

"Was your mom ever properly diagnosed with dementia pre-surgery? You say the MRI was initially meant to hopefully get the diagnosis but I assume the doctor immediately jumped to the tumor they found being the cause of the memory issues?

Vascular dementia is one of the most common forms of dementia; it occurs when blood flow to the brain becomes slowed down or blocked and this causes tissue damage. Multi-infarct dementia is what my Grandmother has and it took us a solid 3-4 years to have CT scans and MRIs done to confirm that she was having small, silent strokes which was the cause of her memory issues. They were such small strokes  that for years the damage didn't show up on scans.

If this was by chance the reason behind your mother's dementia as well, there is a good chance the surgery probably caused more trauma and kind of fast-forwarded her severity. Every patient is different, of course. My Grandmother spent 7 years slowly getting worse until April 2015, which is when something snapped in her brain. She went from manageable to psychotic and physically abusive in a day and in less than a year, what little memory she had left has completely left her.

Unfortunately, your doctors all should have looked further into what caused the dementia rather than just assume the tumor was causing it, if that's in fact what happened. Maybe then they could've taken a little time to go over all options and figure out which would've been the best course of action to minimize the mental ramifications surgery can have on dementia patients.

"I was (and still am) in my 20s when I lived with and cared for my grandmother who had dementia. I can really relate to a lot of what you're talking about. Poor hygiene, name calling, and asking the same question over and over are all part of the process. You have to help her use the bathroom, brush her teeth, and bathe her because it sounds like she is beyond understanding how to do those things.

Being a caregiver for someone with dementia is very stressful. It sounds like you may be dealing with more than you can handle. I think the other commenters here gave excellent advice. I think it's time to look into having a caregiver come in at nights or look at a long-term care facility.

"You are so right, I have had so many positive experiences with music for my 90 year old grandma! She can't remember anything for half a minute, but she still remembers the melodies (and sometimes even words) to certain songs from her youth. When those songs play, she often hums / sings along and is generally happy, peaceful, and distracted, focused on the music. Her joy is even greater when I sing along with her, it makes her laugh so happily. And awesomely enough, I can even go away for a few minutes to fix something without her worrying or following me as she usually would, I just hear her humming happily from the other room.

We built her a ""music button"" a few months ago so she can at least sometimes listen to music even when we are not there: We attached a light switch to the table, wrote ""MUSIC"" on it and ""ON"" and ""OFF"" on the respective sides, so that when she comes into her kitchen and inspects the button, she sometimes manages to turn on music by herself for herself. Pic: https://www.dropbox.com/s/kmn5fv81593h06d/20151020_161132.jpg

We built the button by buying a simple bulky on-off light switch and hooking it to a raspberry pi, a cheap tiny computer that you can easily program to do what you want when the electricity is turned on. We filled it with 20-30 songs we know she recognises and likes and those just start playing via the connected audio boxes whenever she presses the button. Total cost around 100€ including cheap audio boxes.

Finding songs she recognises was also relatively easy: I digitalised old cds she had lying around, searched online for songs from old cassettes, and just generally played a lot of oldie and classical stuff from her youth times from youtube. If she didn't recognise a song she just didn't really react and we talked about the same things as always, if she did recognise them she just sort of lit up and sometimes started humming or asking what that song was called while it played.",,,,Seriouslyfatcat,,,1458390974,t5_2rfqf,t3_49z1i9,t3_49z1i9,1,1460744873,0,0,d15lynl,dementia,1,,

"Oh. This is so hard! We went through the same with my FIL. No one wanted to stand up to him (very forceful man). So, his life was a complete shambles by the time we got him taken care of.

First thing you need to do is educate yourselves and your family. Books, videos, Alzheimer's association website, etc. Ultimately this will be harder on all of you, than on him. You must learn to set aside your desire to reason with him, to test his memory, to bring him back to the way he was, to be angry at his bad behavior. He can't help it, and can't control it.

Learn about the resources and options in your area. Best to get with a good local elder law attorney and review all the paperwork that you need to have in place (I'll get to that in a bit).

Next, talk to his doctor and come up with a plan to get him in. You may have to use some trickery or manipulation; but it's for his own good. Remember that he knows something is wrong, and I promise you he is terrified. He is losing his whole purpose in life, and identity. 

With my FIL, we said. ""You seem to be doing some strange things and forgetting a lot. We are are worried that you may have had a stroke (Which is a real possibility). We need you to get looked at and make sure everything is OK."" He may resist, but don't back down. ""Great. If everything is fine, your doctor will sign off and we will drop it."" Unfortunately for my FIL, his doctor may have also been in early dementia and would not address it. He diagnosed, what was obviously Fronto-temporal dementia, as ""typical age-related memory loss"" and caused the whole thing to go down in a much worse way. Make sure it's a qualified doctor to address geriatric issues.

Not to give false hope, but a severe vitamin B defiency can cause these symptoms; so everything needs to be ruled out. Your father does need hope, so tell him of the most hopeful outcomes in order to convince him to go. He's not in his right mind, so don't feel bad about fudging the truth a little. 

The doctor's visit may be a good time to have the routine conversation about end of life decisions. Everyone should have a living will and power of attorney. HIPAA is so strong that they won't let anyone do anything without it. POA is a magical document that will be a lifesaver for you. Get everyone, who will be involved in his care, on it and try to get him to sign it. ""Listen Mom and Dad, we need to do this; so that we can have the power to make sure that we are able to take care of you.""

Hopefully, the doctor can get through to him. Meet with the elder law attorney and get everything in place for both parents. It will seem less threatening this way. Do be prepared for paranoia and pushback, though. One of the things the attorney can help with is to educate you about Medicaid (assuming you are in U.S.?) or whatever assistance is available to you.

Worst case scenario is that he refuses everything and you have to go the legal route. If the doctor does not take away his license, you can petition for an evaluation. You can also petition to have him declared incompetent, and get guardianship; but that's a lengthy, expensive process.

"Apologies in advance for the wall of text.

The delusions began as a part of Sundown Syndrome. In the beginning it began as it's named - with the sun going down and persisting till bedtime. But the time frame has expanded now; currently the delusions begin after lunch (around 12:30) and persist until he goes to bed at 9:00 PM. He is often groggy in the morning and calm enough, but he has days when he wakes up delusional and the entire day is spent trying to keep him from hurting himself.

He speaks to a little boy - has detailed conversations and all. This isn't a worrisome one. But several times he has been absolutely convinced there is a little girl drowning on the couch and will do almost anything he can to get to her. When we don't take him seriously he yells and yells and continues to try and get out of his seat and gets more agitated each time. Efforts to try and ""save"" the girl only make things worse because we're ""doing it wrong.""

Lately he sees the room he's in as being on fire, and attempts escape the flames. Most of his more common delusions involve him needing to go somewhere and do something. Buy a battery, fix a car, get out of the river that flows through the den, go to work, be at his post (brief stint in the military in the 1950s), or go to see the people waiting for him on the docks. He also refuses to believe the house he's lived in for 45 years is his home, and constantly wants to go ""home.""

He's never worked around water and never on a river, but water and rivers are frequent occurrences in his delusions. Fire, as I mentioned before, is now becoming quite common as well.

The problem is his attempts to get up and walk (he can't). We take him to different areas. He has more than one chair and a wheelchair we can take him places with. The particular chair (or whatever he's sitting in) isn't important - anything he's in, he will attempt to get out of when he is delusional. He refuses to believe he can't walk and hates us already because we're ""forcing him to stay in the chair.""

He does get enough water, and he is on a high-protein diet and eats well. I've noticed that when he is in delusional mode his pupils are pinpoint in size and he sometimes cannot see me standing in front of him. Efforts to speak to him are often ignored, and it takes shouting to be heard by him. His hearing is otherwise fine.

His physical therapist just dropped him because he refuses to cooperate. We do moderate mobility exercises as we can (he won't cooperate much) and have a small pedal exerciser for his legs.

I don't need something that is an all-day solution, but something that can be used at times when I need to be in two places at once. My mother stays with him at all times, but he's too strong for her to stop for long. We use a lifting belt as a seatbelt in his wheelchair, but he manages to squirm under or out of it given enough time.

It's definitely harder to be invested &amp; kind &amp; forgiving when it's not really something you signed on for. It's hard anyway, but once that resentment starts building, every little thing is hard &amp; hurtful. 

I'm glad I didn't come off as offensive. I was trying to be honest, and sometimes I can be harsh. It wasn't intended to be critical or judgmental, I swear. I understand completely the situation you're in. 

Until you guys have a long term solution, my best advice is to breathe, and focus on this: ""so what?"" So what if she hides things? You can find them eventually. So what if she refuses your meal? Put it in the fridge and offer it again next time. Don't let her behaviors ruin your day &amp; sanity. Don't sweat the small stuff, and pick your battles wisely.

"My grandmother had the same form of dementia. I lived with her and helped take care of her. Here are some of my personal tips, although things may differ for you:

* Like toilet training a child, it took time to get gma used to those Depends-type underwear. To help prevent mess at night, we also bought puppy pads and placed them over the mattress (and over a towel) but under the bed sheet.

* She NEVER took her medicine and would last forever arguing with us about it. So we took a trick from her own playbook. My cousin remembers helping my own grandmother care for her mother (my great-gma) back in the 80s, when she had the same problems. My grandma would make a pot of decaf coffee, grind the pills to powder, and mix the medicine into the cup of coffee along with cream and sugar. My grandmother's own trick worked on her, too. I did this every day, morning and night. 

* Alternatively, I would buy pudding packs and fresh bananas. I grind the pills to powder, mix in with a single-serving container of pudding and some extra sugar to help cut bitterness, and serve with freshly sliced banana mixed in. My gma LOVED pudding (she would be oddly obsessive about it at times), so this worked when the coffee trick didn't.

* If she doesn't want to eat, I pulled another trick from my own grandmother herself. (Bless her, that woman was as clever, sharp, and witty as anyone I've known before her dementia.) When my grandpa had cancer and wouldn't eat, my grandmother would blend ice cream with those chocolate Ensure/Boost drinks to serve it like a milkshake. This worked for my grandma only sometimes, because her appetite really fluctuated day to day.

* Speaking of foods, I noticed one main consistency: the more sugar she consumed, the worse or more frequent her ""episodes"" would occur. I tried to keep sugar intake to a minimum, with only a little for coffee or for dessert at night. Her meals usually consisted of toast with peanut butter or oatmeal; a meat with veggies; and fresh fruit to snack on. We would sometimes get her McDonald's when she wanted it. 

* I am/was in my 20s when I took care of her. None of my friends understood, and why should they? They have no experience that compares to this, especially if they don't have kids where at least care giving is a 24 hour duty. I would get so upset when I planned weeks in advance for a respite worker to come Saturday, so that I could go out for the day with a friend - only to have that friend cancel on me Friday night. This happened pretty frequently. They just don't understand what you're going through and how much preparation it takes to get away for even a day, let alone a weekend. Love life? Unless you already have an understanding SO, it will be hard here too. I didn't bring anyone over. I never stayed out past 11pm, and usually was home earlier than that to relieve whoever was on duty part-time.

* Shower time was always the worst. It just was. Cursing, threats, insults - you name it. That woman was stubborn by nature and it only got worse with her dementia. The best advice I can offer is to try doing it when you have home healthcare there or a family member to help.

* On that note, don't try to do everything yourself. You (or whoever is the primary caregiver) need help. That's okay. 

* In her mind, her momma and daddy were still alive. My siblings were still just babies. She would routinely wake me up in the middle of the night asking me where the babies were. Overtime, I just got used to it. You do what you have to in these situations, and whether you laugh or cry, that doesn't make you a bad person.

* I assure you that even though those strangers mistake you for a kidnapper, the police will be more understanding. I made pretty good friends with the police, fire and EMS services in town. They get calls on this kind of thing, so don't feel panicked if you get a check-in.

* Laugh. Let yourself laugh!! This is not easy in the slightest, and if you can find anything to laugh at - even if it's because she wants to dress herself and ends up putting on a shirt as pants. If your response is to laugh, then do so privately, and don't feel bad about it. You are only human. My grandma said some nutty things.

Yes, dementia will change her. But in hindsight, when she is gone, you will still find moments in these rough times that you think back fondly too. If she is happy that you bought her Fig Newtons, you will remember. You will also remember the showers and arguments, but you will smile as you remember how much she *loved* those Fig Newtons.

Even though she is not 60 yet, call the local council on aging (sometimes called area agency on aging) and see what programs they offer. Also call the state medicaid office regarding ""waiver"" programs.
Call Alz Assn as Callmesquirms recommended. Don't accept just a 800 number; see what local chapter services they have support groups and other resources. Your Dad will benefit from a caregiver support group.

"That's a terrible situation you describe, and the pity is that there is so little recognition of the situational problems that arise (like a spouse who has had a stroke having to care for a violent demented person) and there are so few resources to properly care for the demented person. 

I've a mother AND younger sister with advanced dementia. So I probably know a lot about what your mother and the rest of your family is going through, even although each journey through dementia seems to have its own specific terrible ups and downs which consume not only the direct carer's life but which deplete huge resources in the family, and after that there is really not much left to alleviate the distress of everyone drowning in the chaos of it all. 

I'm not sure whereabouts in the world you are, but I'm in Africa where there are very very few public resources available to assist in dealing with dementia, and the burden of dealing with it falls squarely on the family, and in particular close relatives. 

However, within those circumstances I've found a few things have helped me through the terrible aggression stage: 

First, I have a no questions policy with my mother: I never ask my mother anything but the simplest questions - like, about whether she is thirsty, hungry, needs the toilet, sleepy, or in pain - and I only ever ask her such questions when she is clearly becoming anxious about something and as I ask her the question I'm offering the water, giving her a biscuit, walking her to the toilet, heading her to her bedroom, etc. I never ask her open questions like, how are you, do you want to sit down, etc, because that triggers all sorts of things from anxiety to hallucinations and delusions. 

Second, I have a no rules policy with my mother: She can do whatever she wants for as long as she wants wherever she wants with whatever, as long as she is not breaking things or harming herself or other living things :) So if she walks up and down the passage 50 or more times, I don't tell her I've seen her doing that and I don't tell her to stop. If she breaks her sandwich into tiny bits and lines them up on the table I don't ask her why she is doing that or suggest or ask or tell her to stop. I have a no rules policy because I know rules are totally ineffective because firstly she will never ever remember the rule, and has no idea of how to follow the rule anyway. 

Third, I insisted that doctors who prescribed her meds which did not stopped the violence and aggression, rethink their prescriptions, chop and change the timing and amount of each med over the day, and even re-prescribe new meds until the violence stops. That tactic of mine ended up with most doctors pretty much hating me and I'm sure dreading my calls, but at least I got to a stage where my mother's aggression and violence had more or less stopped - pity is that it was replaced by shuffling, apathetic, anxiety riddled behaviour, but those new behaviours were much safer for my mother and everyone around than the previous uncontrolled violence and aggression. 

Fourth, I gave up thinking that I could go it alone, even with the support of family, and I got basic carers who were reliable enough to come in every single day without fail from 7am  to 5pm, so that I could reclaim as much of my life as I could from dementia. 

Fifth, I stopped trying to stop my mother sliding deeper and deeper into dementia, and instead of fighting to keep her from further incompetence, I started to accept that she was on a terrible journey that I just could not prevent, that there was no end to the dehumanization of her personality and being that was being wrought by the disease afflicting her. I stopped chiding her when she could not drop the toilet paper into the toilet after wiping her bum. I stopped asking her to try and feed herself when clearly she could not. Stopped asking if she remembered who I and other were. etc. 

Don't know if that helps, but there is it. ",,,,seedpod02,,,1457047184,t5_2rfqf,t3_48obfu,t3_48obfu,3,1460417368,0,0,d0mngat,dementia,3,,
"So here's an update. Yes, it is part of her daily regime. It works way, way, way better than any med prescribed by her doctor(s). Discovered that the ideal dose is 20-25mg every 8 hours.  I give her one dose at 7AM and another around 3PM.  The early dose makes her manageable for the caregiver, the afternoon dose helps with sundowning. 
Regarding Doctor support: originally I asked her PCP to authorize the medical marijuana card but their office wasn't trained to do so. They referred me to an office that was and also gave me their full support of the idea. I guess there are a few holdouts in the medical community but I'd be surprised if your doc is against it. 
A little input regarding cost:  I buy a 1000mg container of edible THC oil for $60. Using a 50mg/day consumption rate, thats a 20 day supply. Not insignificant but not impossible for us.  
We did have her try some edible chocolate bars. They look tasty but they smell like decayed lawn clippings. The taste of the active ingredients permeates the candy and my wife was refusing it. A hefty dollop of peanut butter didn't help. The aforementioned THC oil however is unnoticeable when a few drops are added to her favorite tea. Go and figure. 
But here's the important part: my wife is less stressed out and much much happier as a result. No question. Is it a cure?  No. Is it a permanent solution. Of course not. But at this point in time she's happier, I'm happier and all the chaos has been dialed back a little bit.

"What an awkward position to be the daughter of a person with dementia faced with this problem.  

It is difficult to weigh in with judgement here because I believe these things should be weighed on a case by case basis.  I only know what the piece says.  Which, obviously would tend to be biased to the daughter who wrote it's point of view.  It would help to know if a physician had stated that this person is incapable of consent.  Leaving it up to the daughter, even if she has power of attorney for her mom, still raises ethical issues.  The daughter has a conflicting interest to make decisions that make the daughter happy and not simply whatever is in the best interest of her mother.  This is why physicians don't treat their own family members.  Of course, usually the dementia patient's children are their power of attorney.  No one else knows them as well and cares about them as much.  

However, the whole jealousy thing and ""concern"" that her mother would get injured from the sexual activity without any research into whether that is a really serious possibility or the consult of a doctor into that or even a physicians opinion as to whether or not she can consent,, all raises red flags to me.

I was her live-in caregiver off and on during that time. Fortunately she was never violent toward me, but she was argumentative, would yell that I was keeping her hostage, and would try to escape the house. Usually this happened in the middle of the night. Sometimes, I just let her walk through the house, fiddling with a basket of unfolded washcloths or sorting through her old purses until she wore her energy thin.

You could also ask about admitting her to a NH on a trial basis, which some NHs will do and others won't. With a positive report from the psych unit, that might help too. I agree with another poster who said to look specifically for dementia/memory care units; many NHs are not equipped for dementia patients.

"I have been taking care of my grandmother for 3 years and have weathered quite a few hospital stays. Every time her Dementia went through the roof, and for a variety of reasons. Mostly she was completely out of her comfort zone. Her schedule was jacked up, the place was unfamiliar, new people coming on and off shift, unfamiliar sounds, food, lights, faces, everything. It is a lot to process when you think about it. Now add to that extra brain payload a health issue that is taxing the body and causing internal stress. 

Every hospital visit was like torture. She didn't know what the hell was going on. If I dared leave her side I usually got a call within a few hours saying gram is trying to leave or refusing meds. It was just bad. Really bad. After each extended hospital stay I noticed grams Dementia was a worse. Not just her Dementia, but overall her health took a hit. She never bounces back fully after any major health event. It usually took AT LEAST a month to get back to even 80%. These hospital stays were minor by comparison to brain surgery.

As for the surgeons having tunnel vision, nearly all of my family is in medicine, my husband included, and if 4 neurosurgeons were consulted, just about every outcome was discussed and trust me, this was the best of all outcomes if they all were vouching for the surgery. 

I've had more conversations with doctors and specialists in the past 2 years than I ever thought I would have in a lifetime. The medical care route generally devolves into the 'lesser of 2 evils', ie which manner of care will cause less damage. It sucks when a loved one gets to that point.

"Thank you for the link, I am very interested. Sounds like a great bill, but from what I could tell there is something still very important missing. The bill says it will help with the cost of *care planning* which is great, but Medicare is severely lacking when helping with the cost of day to day caregiving. Right now Medicare will only pay 20 hours a week for a nurse (not a CNA, health aide, or family member) to care for someone with dementia in the home. Also, If a person only has Social Security for income (and nothing else). It is extremely difficult to find decent skilled nursing facilities that will except someone with dementia. **This needs to change.** Until congress and the president pass a bill that also improves Medicare coverage for caregiving expenses, the burden of this disease is still going to be to overwhelming for most.  

This bill is definitely a move in the right direction, but for most people with dementia this is a very long protracted illness. Sometimes 10 to 20 years.

"Honestly, this all sounds like typical dementia behavior. 

1. Lock your bedroom doors, closets where you put important things, etc. Usd paper plates and plastic forks. Who cares if she takes them? Sometime when she's out of the house, go in with a garbage bag for the paper/plastic, and find any real dishware she might have taken. 

2. This is typical dementia. Of course she's repeating questions. Her brain can't hold new information. If you're about to lose your cool, get up and walk away, or excuse yourself ""to the bathroom"" for a few minutes. 

3. Get double bolted locks, so she can't get out without a key. There are also cheap alarms you can stick onto the door, so it will chime when it opens. 

4. Before she leaves the bathroom, go in with her. Hand her the soap, turn on the water, and demonstrate what to do. It's the same thing with showering- not only do they forget they haven't showered, but they might also forget HOW to do it, and their brain often plays tricks on them- the water coming from shower head can look scary, it might feel cold even though it's warm, they might be afraid of slipping or think the bath water is deep even though it's quite shallow. If nothing else, use nice scented anti bacterial lotion, and try saying ""hold out your hands"" and when she does, put some on and demonstrate rubbing it in. Get Lysol spray and Lysol wipes, and just do a quick wipe down of door handles, sink handles, etc.


I don't think you should be her caregiver either. I'm not trying to be harsh, but you don't sound compassionate or understanding. Maybe it's compassion fatigue &amp; you're just burned out, but maybe this just isn't something you should do. Not everyone should be a caregiver. It sure doesn't come naturally to me. I get it- I'm 23 and caring for my grandmother, she's exactly like what you've described and worse. This disease is a bitch, and caring for someone with it is extremely hard. I wouldn't judge or blame you for not wanting to do it. You're still young, and probably missing out on a lot of opportunities. I'm still in my early 20s, but for several years I was living like an 80 year old, and I regret a lot of missed opportunities and the ability to be young &amp; spontaneous. I was with my grandma 24/7, but was struggling physically (migraines getting worse, gaining weight, very depressed) and couldn't afford to not work. Now I'm with her only on weekends (her aide is Monday-Friday) and it's been great for me. There's a light at the end of the tunnel, I promise you. &lt;3 

 It's important to understand that she isn't doing these things on purpose- yeah, maybe some of it is due to her personality and habits before the dementia. But she has a brain disease. Her brain is literally dying. Think about how scary that must be for her. Even in my grandmother's more advanced stage, she KNOWS something is wrong, although she won't admit it outright. She is incapable of thinking logically or rationally like you and I do. The brain chemistry changes- they lose taste perception, temperature perception... Sometimes the only thing that truly tastes ""good"" to them would be disgusting for us. 

I understand your frustration with the daily chaos, I really do. It's exhausting. In the past hour, I've ""made dinner"" twice because she refused to eat the first time, I've persuaded her that she doesn't need to get dressed to go to the doctor (it's 8 pm), helped her pick out 5 outfits for wherever she's convinced she needs to go, snuck the dog out to pee (she refuses to let the dog out), dodged tons of questions about dead family members (ps- don't say they're dead. Tell a white lie. Mine is ""your parents are safe in Florida, with your sister""), brought her in from outside twice, mashed meds in some ice cream because she refuses to take them... It never ends. Unless you feel a calling to care for someone, it's a daily grind and a chore. It became easier for me when I started looking at it as a job, not as caring for my family member. I see her more as my patient than family, and that helps me cope. 

Check out aplaceformom, your local Alzheimer's association, and other caregiver support resources. I'm not sure if it's national, but there's an awesome one near me called care2caregivers that has been a wealth of information for me. Call your local agency of aging, or even adult protective services for your county- they should be able to point you in the direction of finding a home, getting on a wait list, and figuring out how to pay. If Mom doesn't agree to make a change, then move out and let her figure it out for yourself. It won't take long for her to see reality. Stay with a friend or family member ( going from place to place for a few nights each, if possible). Talk to someone at your school to see if they have any temporary/emergency housing. 

((Big Hugs)) 

ps. If you ever feel like you're about to lose it, and are a danger to yourself or others- WALK AWAY. Go sit outside, go for a walk around the block, lock yourself in the bathroom, whatever you have to do to stay safe. And while you're figuring out the more long term arrangements, get on Craigslist, care.com, see if any aides at the day center want extra hours, ask through word of mouth... Find someone to supervise her, even if all they do is make sure she doesn't walk away! Your health (mental and physical) is important too!!",,,,applesangria,,,1457830585,t5_2rfqf,t3_4a5e3n,t3_4a5e3n,8,1460608343,0,0,d0xpspd,dementia,8,,

"Every person with dementia is very different. This is the advice I give my family.

Just go with the flow. 

Ignore the meltdowns. If she seems upset, do not try to engage, it may only confuse her or agitate her further. Let someone who is more aware of her behaviors diffuse any issues. Keep conversation simple. BRING PICTURES!! She may or may not recognize you now, but there is a way higher likelihood of her recognizing old pics of you and the family. Looking through a bunch of old photos is sometimes very therapeutic. Socially it is low impact on the brain, and old memories/long established memories linger the longest. Looking through photos also puts less pressure on you to find the right thing to say. Bring a giant stack and describe the happy events in the pictures. No sad pics for obvious reasons. 

Mellow, neutral tones and relaxed body language is a must. Think Zen and you'll be fine. When you make eye contact, smile, not grin, but a warm ""you are safe because we love you"" smile. 

This is usually how I like to describe dementia to help someone understand the demolition derby that is going on in the brain:

Imagine tomorrow you wake up and instead of seeing a familiar world, all the colors are inverted and the objects are inside out. You are anxious, your environment and everyone in it feels somewhat familiar, yet totally alien. You know it is all wrong, and you can't fix it. Now think about how you would want to be approached under those circumstances. ",,,,DoctorFlimFlam,,,1458194142,t5_2rfqf,t3_4arb3g,t3_4arb3g,3,1460699130,0,0,d12z2us,dementia,3,,

"Thank you for the response and the offer.

I hadn't heard of validation therapy before, but it sounds very much like what we tried in the beginning. We went along with his delusions at first, but we invariably make some mistake because of discrepancies between what we would say and what he was seeing in his mind, and any small mistake sends him immediately into a rage with him yelling about how we're lying or tricking him. 

I asked my mother about him not saving anyone and she doesn't know of anything like that ever happening. His adult sister committed suicide by gun about thirty years ago, so it may be her he's seeing. His other sister died of Alzheimers about fifteen years ago.

My father always had a quick temper during my life and was horribly physically abusive in his day, so he's not afraid to strike out when he's angry. He is slow, however, and it's easy to catch his fists when you're ready for them. He's managed to strike my mother more than once, however, so we've stopped going down that path.

And as to music, he hates it. My mother told me that even when they were dating, he never liked music. Never danced, never liked listening to the radio. He was raised on a hard-working farm and always saw frivolities like music, games, and other things as wastes of time. He was very involved in Boy Scouts, however, and spent the majority of his time there. He even missed several of his own childrens' birthdays because he was busy with Boy Scouts.

In his later years, he would spend hours every day watching Fox News, so we leave that on for him. He can read a clock, but he can't seem to read words. When he asks for the newspaper we give it to him but he looks at it listlessly and can't seem to make out anything. Eventually he throws it to the floor in frustration.

As to the blog post, I'm not sure about the rules. Each subreddit has their own rules, and I see nothing in the sidebar here about not posting a blog. If you want, you can always send the link as a private message rather than a post; there's no rule against that.

"As a caregiver that reads and studies everything I can about dementia, it is my understanding that any time someone with dementia is injured, they never fully recover back to the level they were before.

Not to mention the effects of anesthesia on someone with dementia. From what I have learned, and I could be wrong, it sounds like you mom my never recover to the level she was before surgery.

"This is a great resource 

www.alz.org

This is an Alzheimer's site but has lots of info on several types of dementia. Early symptoms, other links to great info, resources to services in your area. Just an overall good place to start.

There are several types of dementia. Alzheimer's is just the most common. Learning as much as you can about dementia will help you be able to recognize if your moms symptoms are dementia related or something else.

If you mom continues to display these behaviors, she really needs to start the process of getting a diagnoses. If she does have dementia, the earlier she can get diagnosed the better off she will be.

Step 1 - Try to get her to see her General Practitioner and make sure he/she knows about your moms recent behaviors, and memory issues. Her GP will give her a complete physical and blood test to rule out anything physical. Then Step 2 - He/she should refer your mom to a Neurologist who will order a brain scan or MRI. Then Step 3 - the Neurologist will either refer her to a Psychiatrist for cognition testing or the neurologist may be able to diagnose her without the cognition test. Different doctors approach this issue a little different, but the main thing is to get her to see her doctor. - Good luck    ",,,,fitsme2atee,,,1459322866,t5_2rfqf,t3_4ciiiu,t3_4ciiiu,2,1460972632,0,0,d1it9km,dementia,2,,

"Grandma for the same way before she passed last year. Always talking about her babies and such like she was 30 years back in time taking care of my mom and her siblings. You could always try partly feeding the hallucinations. So like if he is talking about some one he thinks he sees acknowledge it as if it's real. Such as

""What's Jerry doing in the closet?"" 

Tell him jerrys sorting out old clothes or something. Anything to give credit to what they're seeing. This way you don't tell him he's wrong and that there's nothing there, doing so usually stresses them out because they the hallucinations are so vivid to them",,,,tootacticool,,,1458736158,t5_2rfqf,t3_4bjqpj,t3_4bjqpj,2,1460827180,0,0,d1adhui,dementia,2,,

Do not mean to be insensitive, but LOL that's funny as hell. My mom that Alzheimer's and sometimes she will say the craziest things. Sometimes I have to step away and just laugh my ass off. I think being able to laugh at some of the craziness can be healthy.

"Thank you for painting a detailed and vivid picture.  It's hard to start to remedy over text and in days.
This reminds me of an elder resolving traumatic issues in the past, maybe even from childhood. Naomi Feil created her Validation Therapy based on the theory that older adults when in a resolution stage show these signs. Google ""validation therapy"" and read about it.  Takes time, trial and error.  You can do it. You can ask me questions. It's an educated guess that the girl drowning was someone he failed to save literally (whether he's ever mentioned or not) or she is a symbol of something he could not save.  
The other thing that may help a bit right now is a music intervention 30-60 minutes before sundowning (11:30am). This is based on Linda Gerdner's research at Stanford.  Find out his favorite music - don't guess- and be specific- specific artists and songs. I'm new to Reddit, and not sure if I can share my blog post on music and dementia to help.  I will if that is allowed. Or I can send directly. My edu and exp- I've read The Validation Breakthrough, close to a masters in gerontology, educator.

"I'm a neuropsychologist, so this is a really interesting question to me: I very rarely deal with patients who aren't willing to get checked out, since I'm the one doing the checking! 

That having been said, but shoot-from-the-hip advice is to set aside the intangibles or symptoms he can easily hand-wave away. Focus on concrete problems. A possible avenue is the money aspect. It is a statement of fact that he has been working for months without getting paid. It is a statement of fact that he has not been paying bills on time. Why is he working without getting paid? Then, couch seeing a neurologist as a way of possibly addressing these difficulties. If you can get him to buy in to that, then you'll be good to go.

Regardless, your family should probably look into ways that financial responsibilities can be moved away from him to your mother. A power of attorney is probably too much to hope for right now, though.

Finally, I'd direct your reading regarding etiologies towards [FTD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontotemporal_dementia). I am **certainly** not offering a diagnosis over the internet, but if you haven't come across this one yet, you *may* find it illuminating. You really must see a specialist for proper diagnosis though, the process of which is usually: Primary Care -&gt; Neurologist -&gt; (many, including neuroimaging and a neuropsychologist)-&gt;back to neurologist for final diagnosis.

Best of luck.

"I do think so, but I can't be absolutely sure as I do not know your father and vascular dementia is very heterogenous.

I have (had) multiple family members with both AD and vascular dementia. Currently, I am developing a technological aid for people with dementia (and other cognitive problems). I've done some research in this field and multiple papers state a benefit of assistive tech. However;

- work with pictures/ video, as little text as possible.
- Make sure your dad understands why the procedure is in place. It is sort of stigmatising and many people with cognitive disabilities don't like that.
- Make sure your dad can get out in case of emergency.
- Make sure emergency services can get in.

The basic premise of them looks very good, in any way!",,,,Faduan,,,1458599306,t5_2rfqf,t3_4asq0k,t3_4asq0k,1,1460793424,0,0,d18f7f0,dementia,1,,
