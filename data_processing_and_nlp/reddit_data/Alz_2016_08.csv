"Most non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs do not effectively scavenge peroxynitrite, which is likely one of the primary cause of Alzheimer's disease.  

""Most non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were moderately (indomethacin, diclofenac, naproxen, tolmetin) or only weakly (sulindac, ibuprofen, aurothioglucose, flurbiprofen, sulphasalazine, salicylate, penicillamine disulphide) effective in preventing tyrosine nitration and alpha 1-antiproteinase inactivation by peroxynitrite...

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8694578

Mefanamic acid inibits inducible nitric oxide production and this is why it is different from other NSAIDS (inducible nitric oxide combines with superoxides to produce peroxynitrite).

""We found that mefenamic acid attenuates the neurotoxicities induced by amyloid beta peptide (Abeta)(1-42) treatment and the expression of a Swedish double mutation (KM595/596NL) of amyloid precursor protein (Swe-APP) or the C-terminal fragments of APP (APP-CTs) in neuronal cells. We also show that mefenamic acid decreases the production of the free radical nitric oxide and reduces cytochrome c release from mitochondria induced by Abeta(1-42), Swe-APP, or APP-CTs in neuronal cells. In addition, mefenamic acid up-regulates expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-X(L). Moreover, our study demonstrates for the first time that mefenamic acid improves learning and memory impairment in an Abeta(1-42)-infused Alzheimer's disease rat model. Taking these in vitro and in vivo results together, our study suggests that mefenamic acid could be used as a therapeutic agent in Alzheimer's disease.""

My mother was in late stage 5 to early stage 6, and then all of a sudden within 4 months time she rapidly declined through stage 6 and 7 and passed away. Which in the case of Alz. was a blessing. Some people can linger through the final stages for quite some time.

"No, mefenamic acid has not been tested in clinical trials for Alzheimer's. Previous NSAID clinical trials are thought to have failed due to the poor brain penetrance of drugs like Ibuprofen and Naproxen - if the drug can't get to the inflammation in the brain, the drug will have no effect.

"I'm so sorry you and your family are going through this. Dementia and general memory problems can be caused by many things including stress, medications and several diseases. It does not mean she has Alzheimer's disease, but with a family history it is important to check it out. Get her to set up a doctors appointment and if you can't be there with her, try calling or writing a letter to her doctor explaining what you have witnessed. 

If she is the primary caregiver, do what you can to ease the burden when you can. How long has it been since she took a vacation, went to the dentist, went to her own doctor or went out to lunch on her own?  It is very common for caregivers to neglect themselves as there is too much for a single person to handle. 

If you aren't able to help in that way because you live elsewhere or your schedule is restrictive search the Internet for adult day cares, support groups, even just fun activities your mom might enjoy taking your grandmother to. I considered myself knowledgable in my area and discovered a program again the other day.  When I first took note of the program a few years ago it didn't fit our needs and I forgot about it until someone brought it to my attention last week and I realized it would be perfect. (Last week I realized I no longer have to search out Velcro shoes for my SO, because while they were necessary at one time so he could put on and take off his own shoes but a friend pointed out I put on and take off his shoes so who cares if they tie or Velcro). 

Just try to be supportive of your mom personally as well. This is scary for everyone involved but even if she is in denial, it must be terrifying. If you can bring her favorite lunch by, or have a pizza delivered:) I have a dear friend who visits once a month and sits with my SO for a few hours and pushes me out of the house to do something for myself. Last month she was on vacation across the globe on the day of her normal visit. I received a call from her the day before and she asked me if I would be home. Around the time she normally shows up the doorbell rang and it was a grocery store delivery guy with a few staples and one of my favorite candy bars.

Here is a brief excerpt.

""The possible NO [nitric oxide] over expression in the chronic progress of the AD can contribute to neurodegenerative disorder, through protein nitration by reactive peroxynitrite. This compound is a potent oxidant that can alter membrane and cytosol proteins, affecting their physical and chemical nature and serving as an important link in the chain of events leading to oxidative damage observed in AD [22]. Peroxynitrite can nitrate in a protein tyrosine residues thus preventing the phosphorylation, thereby causing a dysfunction which in turn could lead to cell death. Peroxynitrite can also oxidatively modify both membrane and cytosolic proteins, thus affecting their physical and functional properties[39,8]. Following these observations, the aim of the present work was to investigate the role played by NO and peroxynitrite in platelets from AD patients...""

"Woo, pseudoscience, voodoo, etc. are all false words.  We don't apply them to medicines that don't work.  Something either works or it does not whether it is ""modern"" medicine or ""alternative"" medicine; whether it is synthetic medicine or medicine from natural products.

Now that we have established a scientific foundation for these compounds, let's take it one step further.  Through nitration and oxidation, peroxynitrite (ONOO-) inhibits the synthesis and release of neurotransmitters required for short-term memory, sleep, mood, social recognition and alertness, inhibits the transport of glucose and limits the flow of blood in the brain which can lead to delusions, prevents the regeneration of neurons, and contributes to the death of neurons via the activation of caspase 3.  Now quotes and charts that locate the role of peroxynitrite in Alzheimer's disease.

“TNF-induced PKC activation mediates ONOO- generation, which results in the oxidation and depletion of glutathione…”

“Malinow’s team found that when mice are missing the PKC alpha gene, neurons functioned normally, even when amyloid beta was present. Then, when they restored PKC alpha, amyloid beta once again impaired neuronal function. In other words, amyloid beta doesn’t inhibit brain function unless PKC alpha is active.”

“The hippocampi – the brain centres for learning and memory – are one of the earliest regions to be sabotaged by Alzheimer’s pathology. Our data revealed that GSH [glutathione] levels plummet in the hippocampi of patients with Alzheimer’s as well as those with MCI [mild cognitive impairment].""

[Clinical trials with over-the-counter supplements have concentrated either on items which suppress inflammation, or on antioxidants which scavenge oxygen derived free radicals. Most of these items have proved to be worthless in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Similarly most drugs used to treat Alzheimer’s disease do little to slow the deterioration, but instead offer a mild temporary symptom relief. However, evidence has been accumulating that the primary driver of Alzheimer’s disease is a nitrogen derived free radical called peroxynitrite, which may mediate both amyloid and tau accumulation as well as their toxicity. Excellent results have been obtained with peroxynitrite scavengers, with reversals of Alzheimer’s disease in human clinical trials being repeatedly demonstrated. IMHO, the only thing which may be preventing the abolition of Alzheimer’s disease is the mental inertia of scientists, as well as the bureaucrats who fund them. Unfortunately, most bureaucrats keep throwing money into repeatedly testing discredited interventions, while ignoring successful ones. Common sense is anything but…]

Here are the specific peroxynitrite scavengers used in the studies above.

Evaluation of the peroxynitrite scavenging activity of heat-processed ginseng.

Abstract
To ascertain the principal active peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) scavenging components of heat-processed Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer (sun ginseng [SG]), the ONOO(-) scavenging activities of fractions and components of SG were compared. The results demonstrated that the ONOO(-) scavenging ability of SG was due to its ether fraction containing phenolic compounds. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis and ONOO(-) scavenging activity tests of the phenolic acids contained in SG identified vanillic acid, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, syringic acid, and maltol as the main active ONOO(-) scavenging components of SG. The ONOO(-) scavenging activities of phenolic acids and maltol were dependent on the degrees of their proton donating ability.

Eugenol in rosemary essential oil via aromatherapy.

Eugenol (4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol) is a fragrant compound that is commonly contained in various sorts of plants, especially in spices and medicinal herbs. Eugenol has been used for dental analgesic, which also has anticonvulsive and anti-microbial activities. Besides, anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activities of eugenol are known. A body of evidence suggests that eugenol can be used as a drug for treatment of Alzheimers disease (AD). According to recent reports, the extract of a medicinal plant Rhizoma Acori Graminei (RAG) alleviates neurotoxicity induced by amyloid beta peptides (Aβ) in vitro and the active constituent of RAG is eugenol. Eugenol inhibits Aβ-induced excessive influx of calcium ion into neurons that causes neuronal death. Moreover, eugenol possesses an antidepressant-like activity. Eugenol, like other antidepressants, increases expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene in the hippocampus, which is necessary for an antidepressant to exhibit its activity. Furthermore, eugenol inhibits monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and may restore monoamines that are decreased in the brain of patients with depression. Thus, eugenol can be a good medicine for AD and depression. Here we suggest that eugenol and its analogs can be used also for other diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) including Parkinsons disease (PD). This article reviews the previous investigations concerning effects of eugenol including its analogs on the CNS and describes perspectives of this highly potential compound.

THC and cannabidiol in medicinal marijuana oil.

In glaucoma, the increased release of glutamate is the major cause of retinal ganglion cell death. Cannabinoids have been demonstrated to protect neuron cultures from glutamate-induced death. In this study, we test the hypothesis that glutamate causes apoptosis of retinal neurons via the excessive formation of peroxynitrite, and that the neuroprotective effect of the psychotropic Δ9-tetrahydroxycannabinol (THC) or nonpsychotropic cannabidiol (CBD) is via the attenuation of this formation. Excitotoxicity of the retina was induced by intravitreal injection of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) in rats, which also received 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-n-oxyl (TEMPOL,a superoxide dismutase-mimetic), N-ω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor), THC, or CBD. Retinal neuron loss was determined by TDT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay, inner retinal thickness, and quantification of the mRNAs of ganglion cell markers. NMDA induced a dose- and time-dependent accumulation of nitrite/nitrate, lipid peroxidation, and nitrotyrosine (foot print of peroxynitrite), and a dose-dependent apoptosis and loss of inner retinal neurons. Treatment with L-NAME or TEMPOL protected retinal neurons and confirmed the involvement of peroxynitrite in retinal neurotoxicity. The neuroprotection by THC and CBD was because of attenuation of peroxynitrite. The effect of THC was in part mediated by the cannabinoid receptor CB1. These results suggest the potential use of CBD as a novel topical therapy for the treatment of glaucoma.

I am not asking people to be uncritical; I am asking people to stop being hypercritical.  It is not a matter of cherry picking; it is a matter of the overwhelming evidence pointing toward peroxynitrite as the route cause of Alzheimer's disease and finding the best peroxynitrite scavengers available to most effectively treat the disease.

"I'm sorry to hear about your struggle. I am in a very similar position; I'm your age, and my mom has early-onset Alzheimer's. I'm her only responsible child, so everything has fallen to me. I put her in a nursing home about three years ago.

You know as well as I do that this really, really sucks. I don't have much to offer you, except for a couple of odd-sounding little bits:

-The saving grace about progressive dementia is that for the patient, the sense of time becomes so distorted that it is meaningless. Her internal timeline won't allow her to keep track of when you're there and when you're gone. Do the best you can, and know that any guilty feelings you have are YOUR feelings; she isn't necessarily suffering when you're not there. She is lucky to have a carrying son who visits her whenever he can. 

-There will come a day sometime soon (depending on what stage your mother is in) when she will not remember you or even recognize you when you visit. As excruciating as this sounds, and as difficult as it is to face, this stage may actually be a HUGE relief for you. It was for me, at least. Though my mom is still alive (if you want to call it that), I have finally been able to ""move on"" and stop feeling guilty for not being there everyday. 

In my own mother's case, my visits now tend to upset her, because she has no idea who I am and I just interrupt her consistent daily routine. Last time I saw her, several family members and I were visiting for a little celebration on her 57th birthday. She was clearly overstimulated, and after about 20 minutes she said, ""Let them go!"" She has lost most of her ability to speak, and this was her gentle way of asking us all to leave. :) 

Anyway, participate in facility events for the families, holiday parties, attend her care-plan meetings with staff, and call her regularly (unless she can no longer use a phone, of course). To help make up for the times when you can't be there, regularly send her little things in the mail. Even just postcards, greeting cards, small gifts, etc. Everyone loves getting mail and it will make her feel loved in your absence. 

Other than that, try to hang in there. This will not last forever. It IS a painfully slow band-aid being ripped off of a really hairy body part, though. But be proud of yourself and give yourself a break. You have a life too, and I'm sure your mother wouldn't want you to put your life on hold for her.

"Of course SparklePantsForAll is right, but getting him to a doctor can be tricky. If he is the kind of person who ""gets enraged at the snap of a finger,"" it's best that he make that decision himself.

My husband was a sweetie pie, but still quite capable of disbelieving unpleasant facts. So what I did was contact his doctor before a routine visit, and ask the doctor to bring up the subject. He did, and my husband said he did seem a little more forgetful lately. The doctor referred him to a neurologist, and we went on from there.

Of course this might be a little more difficult for you since you are not a relative of the patient. But perhaps this is something his daughter can do? It's just a phone call. Hopefully, with your boyfriend's permission of course, the doctor's office will let you go in with your boyfriend for his consultation.

If the doctor does feel that your boyfriend needs further evaluation, do not say things like ""I knew it! You've been very forgetful lately...""

"Hello,
  Im so sorry you and your family are going through this.  It is a lot to take in, try to take things one step at a time.  I am going to provide lots of info as I'm not sure of the situation.  please disregard anything that isn't appropriate for your situation.  

It sounds like some home care might be a good place to start to help with the immediate problem of what to do when he is released form the hospital.  Ask the case manager or a doctor if he can be approved for Home health including a nurse that will check in occasionally, physical therapy, maybe occupational therapy and the all important home health aid.  If this is approved they will send people to the home to provide physical therapy, occupational therapy and the aid will come to help with showers etc a few times a week.  They don't replace care, but they can help strengthen him (again if needed) and the primary care giver will have his help for transfers etc. and having someone handle some of the showers is amazing.  This is temporary and probably will only last a few weeks,  but it gives you time to look at other options.  

It sounds like finances may be a problem.  Home health is sometimes provided by Medicaid if he qualifies.  If he is on Medicaid then I would call a few home health agencies or his doctors office and discuss the qualifications to see if he meets them.

If your father ever served in the military you should see if he qualifies for assistance through the VA.  They can provide home health, medications, Physician care, and possibly a aid and attendance pension that can be used to help pay for assisted living.  
   
Call your local Council on aging.  You may have local options we are unaware of here.  I find googling the county you live in with council on aging after is helpful for finding them.

Check out the website for [The Alzheimers Association](http://www.alz.org/) to find other local resources and look into the support groups as well.  The support groups can also be a great way to get the low down on local services.  

Take care of yourself and make sure who ever the primary care giver is takes time for themselves.  It is insanely easy to let yourself deteriorate while caring for someone with AD",,,,Myfeelingsarehurt,,,1470328099,t5_2r8fp,t3_4w05rb,t3_4w05rb,3,1473219778,0,0,d643fh4,Alzheimers,3,,

"I've worked  in  a few nursing  homes, and currently work at a memory  care assisted  living facility.  


Most of the time families  pack and move everything in before their loved one gets  to the  new place.  They tend  to hang up pictures or decorations  that their  family  member  liked and set it up similar  to  how it was at home.  Bring the bedding there was on the bed at home and put it on the new bed so it looks  familiar, if  they have an easy  chair they  like sitting in they will bring it as well.  

That way when my residents are feeling unfamiliar in a new place  their  room seems somewhat like home so they  are less anxious  and confused. 

Basically have  her new room set up and unpacked before  she arrives.   And bring  whatever  you  can that might  remind her of ""home"".

"Highly recommend getting POA sooner rather than later, if that's a role (decision maker) that you are willing and able to take on. If you do it while he is still somewhat cognizant, it will be much easier. 

What I'm seeing from your post is this list of priorities: 

1) is he able to come home from the hospital? Will he require any PT, OT or surgeries/procedures? 

2) POA 

3) Talk to girlfriend, see what she is and isn't willing to do. Be real and blunt. Will she be willing to change diapers, stay home 24/7? If not, set up a plan for when you/she will hire help.

4). Drivers license taken away, access to car removed. People act like ""taking away the license"" actually does anything, but it's just a piece of plastic. You need to take the keys and/or disable the car. Since he's recently had an accident, I highly recommend that you do NOT GET THE CAR FIXED. This accident is a gift. Rather than being the bad guy, you can play it as ""it's totaled, insurance isn't covering it because you were at fault, there's no money to fix it."" Provide access to transportation or make sure girlfriend is able to take him out frequently, so he doesn't feel isolated or trapped (this can lead to wandering). 

5) GPS monitoring. Alzheimers patients are at a huge risk of being lost, especially if they don't have 24/7 close supervision. This also seems to be more common after the person stops driving, because they might think ""well, I'll just walk there"" and get lost. I used PocketFinder because it worked for the budget. We no longer use it because she has very close supervision. There are tons of options, search them as ""dementia gps,"" ""child gps"" and ""autism trackers."" 

6) There are medications which slow the progression, and others which help manage any anxiety or other symptoms. A geriatric psychiatrist is the specialist you'd want to see. 


Lastly, I'll recommend a few things. Read ""the 24 hour day."" Consider seeing an elder care attorney. This will be especially important if you consider assisted living and/or memory care, because his financial assets and girl friend's assets are probably shared. That can be tricky, because she isn't considered a spouse. They can also help with POA, although that's a pretty easy form you can do yourself. When considering companion care, daily care or live-in home care, there's a ton of options. I've had much better luck with care.com and hiring privately than going through agencies. Medicare does not cover home dementia care, FYI- it provides limited ""home health"" but that has to be approved for certain conditions.",,,,applesangria,,,1470335836,t5_2r8fp,t3_4w05rb,t3_4w05rb,6,1473222218,0,0,d649s1p,Alzheimers,6,,

He forgets names, regular words in conversations and it takes him longer to think of what he wants to say when he is speaking.

"This gets to the root of why non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as mefenamic acid) are not more effective in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.  These drugs activate peroxisome proliferator activated receptors which in turn increases activity of the neuroprotective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (which leads to regeneration of neurons in the hippocampus and increased blood flow in the brain) and reduces inducible nitric oxide production.  However, the tyrosine nitration of this receptor inhibits its function.

""Nitration of tyrosine residues in proteins has been observed in many inflammatory tissues of arthritis, ulcerative colitis, septic shock and ischemia-reperfusion injury...Together, these results indicate that nitration of PPARgamma during inflammation may be involved in a reduction in the control of inflammatory responses and also in the development of resistance to PPARgamma ligand-based therapies against inflammation.""

De-nitration of PPAR receptors is accomplished by peroxynitrite scavengers.  So if you use an NSAID drug in combination with a strong peroxynitrite scavenger (such eugenol in various essential oils via aromatherapy; terpenes such as eugenol, cannabidiol, and low THC in CBD oil from marijuana; ferulic acid, syringic acid, vanillin, p-coumaric acid, and maltol in Korean red ginseng and heat processed ginseng)  your chances of success in human beings is much greater than using an NSAID alone.",,,,Lane_Simonian,,,1471216989,t5_2r8fp,t3_4xdx2m,t3_4xdx2m,0,1473406292,0,0,d6hmt9x,Alzheimers,0,,
