"Hi OP,

My mom (now 64) was diagnosed about 2 years ago with early onset AD and I, my siblings, and father have been doing a lot of stuff trial and error that you might try out to start with. Some specific things you need to think about:      
  
*  Does she understand who is calling on the telephone? We realized that my mom was (and sometimes still is) picking up phone calls from unknown numbers. Going hand in hand with that, also sometimes hanging up on people who needed something from one of us in actuality, or not picking up OUR phone calls. You might consider changing the phone number to a Google number so you can screen what calls get through. Or, at the very least, make sure you have the most important numbers (yours, other family, maybe a neighbor) somewhere she will SEE IT, even if she forgets where it is. We have a bulletin board next to the phone in the kitchen so my mom can see my dad's cell, his office, my cell, and those of my siblings.   
  
* Time might start out fine for her but it gets very jumbled as time goes on. We used to talk about things far in the future (weeks, months) but people with AD have a hard time putting events in order and we've found the most success having a ONE WEEK calendar on our kitchen island where people can dry erase update the day and we have a magnet that we move to indicate what day we are on. The other members of our family share a Google calendar so we can see what people are up to and we add events that we hear about that might be good to take our mom to--more on that later.  We also regularly talk with her about what we are doing the next day and what we are doing next on the current day.
  
* As other commenters have mentioned, you need to have a discussion with your mom while she is still lucid enough to understand about her estate and healthcare. A diagnosis of early onset AD can probably help you sign up for a Social Security/Disability allowance for her. It is fairly easy to do on their website. Here's the alz.org discussion [on the matter.](http://www.alz.org/living_with_alzheimers_social_security_disability.asp) We got our mom a compassionate allowance after her diagnosis. At first we thought we would just stockpile it for end of life care, we ended up starting to use it for 6-hour shift caregivers who now come 4 days a week to help us out.  My mom can still do most of her  every day tasks but they talk with her, go for long walks, and just spend time.   Also, we had a lawyer make a new will for our parents and signed power of attorney forms for both of my parents, which gave two of us power to make financial and health care-related decisions for my mother. It's just easier to get these things done earlier rather than later.
*   Not sure where you are located but just try to google activities in your area, if there are any. It's a little harder for younger onset people because at the beginning, my mom didn't want to hang out with folks much older than she is but often she talks to the volunteers just as much as attendees. We've gone to zoo walks run by the Alzheimer's Association (weekly), cafes with music where everyone sings along, played games, and we signed her up for a support group that one of her caregivers drives her to.   It is amazing to meet up with other people who are going through what you are and the people (as well as their family or caregivers) are some of the nicest people I have ever encountered. Just relentlessly positive.
 

* This will be very hard on you and your family, not just your mom. It is important to try to do all sorts of activities to keep your mom as active as possible, both in a physical and mental sense. If she has interests like reading, see if you can find her a book club (take notes and talk about the plot and characters, etc. before she goes), if she likes dancing, sign the two of you up for a class. One thing I noticed that is pretty heartbreaking is that my mom doesn't actively think of things for herself to do, so if we don't tell her to watch an episode of Criminal Minds or color in her adult coloring book or chop vegetables for dinner, she will just sit and stare off into space. It is so, so important to make your mom feel needed and to try to be as patient as possible. She will forget what she went upstairs for, and then what she went downstairs for, and on and on but OP, try to have a sense of humor about it all.   
* Make sure you keep on top of her medicinal schedule, doctor's appointments, meal schedule, etc. At the beginning, these things might go fine, but over time they will get jumbled and you need to know what she is supposed to be taking when, if there have been any changes, what she's eating, etc. You will end up having a lot of conversations with people who used to deal with your mom but  are now talking with you. (bills, house, cable, credit cards, etc.) Try to learn all your mom's passwords (maybe keep a password log for her?), find out who her doctors are and keep her appointments in your calendar.   
  
Sorry this post is getting super long. If you have ANY questions, please ask. There are a lot of us out here going through the same thing and OP, I've been where you are. We figured out a lot of it as it came and we're still learning every day. You're going to be alright. Keep your mom as positive as possible and make sure you are making time for YOU and not letting the diagnosis consume your life. You can do this.",,,,whateverwillbe,,,1441865702,t5_2r8fp,t3_3k6wuk,t3_3k6wuk,1,1444274164,0,0,cuwigr8,Alzheimers,1,,

My best advice is to read, think carefully about how you might approach this conversation with your dad. Is there anyone else you could talk about this with- his spouse, or maybe even his best friend? It helps to have another perspective. I wish my loved one had been diagnosed earlier, as we could've prepared ourselves better and maybe made some different treatment choices (like medication, moving to assisted living, etc). A neurologist would be best, but a GP is also a fine place to start. It is especially important for people with early onset alzheimers or dementia to be diagnosed early, because there are some unique factors to consider in their care and treatment.

"I am so sorry to hear that you both are going through this, especially after probably feeling some relief in being in remission from the cancer. And you're both so young! I wish you and your mother the best.

First thing I'd do is to look for a local branch of the Alzheimer's Association (www.alz.org). Part of the battle is just getting yourself prepared to deal with everything that is upcoming, and to know what options and resources are available. When my FIL was diagnosed with dementia, they were wealth of information. Not only did we get information about memory care facilities, home healthcare, elder care consultants (I didn't even know such a thing exists!), etc. but also just how to recognize when it's the disease talking and not general unpleasantness coming from your parent. I learned about ""therapeutic lying"" (e.g. it does no good to tell someone their wife is dead, even though it's true, if you're just making him relive that shock over and over again), and about not trying to correct every little fact. If he wants to think my spouse is his sibling instead of his child, no harm done. As long as he feels safe with and loved by us that's what's important. This type of thing is probably a ways down the road for your mom, but it's nice to know ahead of time. 

If you find a local branch, you may need to see them by yourself, depending on your mother's state of mind and how much she wants to be involved in her own care. My spouse and I visited them by ourselves because my FIL thought nothing was wrong (seems to be fairly common), so taking him to talk to a counselor about what to expect with this disease would have been useless. 

Good luck with things, and I hope there is a local branch somewhere nearby because just talking with someone face to face was such a relief. If not, look for other organizations that deal with Alzheimer's and dementia and see if there's any kind of support group available.

"Hi there,

Im a PhD student studying Alzheimer's disease. Im not a medical doctor and I dont know your family or your father's medical history but I can tell you a few general things about Alzheimer's disease (lets call it AD for short) that might help. familial, early onset alzheimer's disease typically starts in the 50s and has a very aggressive progression. if your dad showed signs 4 years ago and has gotten better sense, my guess would be that it isnt early onset. this also depends on if your dads parents/grandparents had early or late onset AD, or if they even had it at all. These could be the initial signs of late onset, which takes a long time to progress to a level that is overt enough for diagnosis by a doctor. Typically people get diagnosed with late onset AD between ages 65-85+. I would certainly consider seeing a doctor about this.

A few things to keep in mind: many things can cause lapses in memory, including environmental factors as well as infections and completely unrelated diseases or drug treatments. Also, there are many forms of dementia besides AD as well. Normal aging also causes decline of memory and some of these ""elderly moments"" (as my aunt likes to put it). Your father's lapses are in no way definitive that he has any form of dementia. But once again, a real doctor will be able to help you much more in that department than I can via the internet.

Lastly, if you and your family are concerned about this, the best way to reduce risk is to remain healthy through diet and exercise. exercise is the most important thing you can do to reduce AD risk at this point. We don't have any drugs that can stop it from developing, or slow/stop its progression once you get it. But there is a lot of evidence that cardiovascular health is strongly related to AD risk. so tell your dad to take a run every morning (and maybe go with him haha!) and talk to a doctor about you concerns.

good luck!

Alzheimer's has taught me how to not take things personal.  I can't say the disease gets better, but the ways you handle it *will* indubitably get better, so just stay tough and keep looking for outlets to talk, vent, whatever you gotta do.

On that note, keep in mind that whatever you do, don't take your frustrations out on your grandpa.

"The molecule myo-inositol is the primary connection between Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.  Individuals with Down syndrome have an extra copy of the gene for the sodium/myo-inositol transporter.  

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10588400

In Alzheimer's disease, high glucose levels or high blood pressure (due to high sodium levels) also leads to high levels of myo-inositol.

High myo-inositol levels eventually lead to amyloid oligomers, plaques, and neurofibrillary tau tangles.  More importantly, high myo-inositol levels lead to high levels of peroxynitrites which are likely the main cause of Alzheimer's disease.

Individuals with Down syndrome also have high levels of hydrogen sulfide which is a peroxynitrite scavenger.  This may explain why people with Down syndrome all eventually develop amyloid plaques and tau tangles, but not all of them develop Alzheimer's disease.  

Similarly, many people with no cognitive impairment or limited cognitive impairment also have plaques and tangles in their brains.  The key is not the plaques and tangles, the key is the amount of oxidative and nitrostative damage caused by peroxynitrites.  As long as that damage is being kept under control by peroxynitrite scavengers cognitive function can largely be maintained.

Prion contaminated growth hormone can lead to the formation of amyloid plaques and more importantly to peroxynitrites--the oxidant likely primarily responsible for Alzheimer's disease.

"Now that is interesting indeed. The first part is easy to see. No PrP produced, no chance for the infectious PrPres to start converting PrP. I'm not as clear about point two. When the article says ""secreted"" it seems to imply that this is simply an extracellular protein, as all prion proteins eventually are. The term 'anchorless' implies, I presume, not 'anchored' to amyloid. This suggests to me that the prion protein doesn't produce disease when not anchored to amyloid, as the quotation says. Yet somehow it increases the amount of amyloid deposited while not being bound to it. The suggestive conclusion is that ""amyloid doesn't cause disease"" unless it is bound to PrP and that, therefore, prions cause disease when bound to amyloid. This would suggest that amyloid is anything but 'protective' as it is part of a complex along with PrP that *does* produce disease.

The article goes on to describe experiments in transmission wherein extracts from 'diseased' animals are infectious while those from non-diseased are not. Fine. This may be obvious. What isn't obvious is that the quotation seems to suggest that binding somehow 'reduces' the likelihood of disease by bring in the word ""massive"" (as opposed to 'non-massive' ?) to describe the plaques formed in mice injected with 'non-disease' extract. I note that *both sources* had ""PrPres deposits"" (with or without amyloid ?). I also note that nothing is said about the plaques produced by injection by the 'diseased' extract.

As you can see all of this confuses me a great deal. I can't see how the amyloid plaque formation is 'beneficial' from the work cited. To me it doesn't follow. Perhaps I am missing something here.

I can see how people can get excited about Alzheimer's research. As far as I can make out as an outsider this is a great field of debate that has been going on for many years and is still far from being resolved.

"I can partially provide insight on this.  The anchored means anchored to phospholipids.  Perhaps, highly relevant, phospholipase C is the enzyme which leads to the release/secretion of PrPc (presumably intracellularly).  This is the same enzyme which leads to the formation of amyloid oligomers and to peroxynitrites.  Hence part of the connection between amyloid oligomers and PrPC.

http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090225/full/news.2009.121.html (I think these researchers are overreaching in suggesting that PrPC is somehow involved in Alzheimer's disease).

Nitration mediated by peroxynitrites and/or by heavy metals is what leads to the formation of amyloid plaques.  Nitration may also play a role in the formation of PrPSc or PrPres (the infectious prion protein).

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14713301

So perhaps in Alzheimer's disease the nitration of amyloid oligomers into plaques results in the sequestering of the infectious prion protein which is then no longer infectious.

"I couldn't agree more. Some Alzheimer's patients have a clinical condition known as [anosognosia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia) in which they truly do not know there is a problem. I think my late husband had this. In the three years from his diagnosis until his death (of unrelated causes), he said only two or three times something like, ""My mind is shot."" Other than that he seemed completely unaware of his disability.

I more than went along with it. I orchestrated the environment and our activities such that he was less likely to be reminded of what he couldn't do. For example, he had been the quintessential ""Mr. Fix-It,"" but got to where he couldn't even change a light bulb. So I got our handyman to come in and fix things when I took my husband out the the doctor or to lunch, so that he wouldn't see someone else doing what he couldn't. When he started to have trouble shaving, I would say, ""Oh look, you missed a spot"" and finish shaving him as though it were completely natural and routine, which it became.

I got into a rhythm with him that was actually quite pleasant. I'd let him take the lead, and we'd talk, sing, observe, whatever, in a kind of slow-motion suspended state. I sometimes miss being like that. Sometimes I think that there's not much difference between ""mindfulness"" and mindlessness.

"What you're describing is called aphasia, and it can be confusing for us and frustrating for them. Unfortunately, it's a ""normal"" part of Alzheimers. My loved one's aphasia has progressed from what you're describing. It can definitely be made worse by times of stress, or if there's a lot of stimulation and commotion happening around him. If you notice a sudden, significant worsening of it (or of any other symptom, really), you should get him checked out for any infections or sources of pain. UTIs are notorious for temporarily worsening behaviors and symptoms.

"An interesting topic indeed.  Here is another possible explanation for how amyloid plaques may by protective against infectious prion proteins.  

From

Amyloid Deposits: Protection Against Toxic Protein Species?

Plaque formation may also prove beneficial in the case of prion disease. PrPres isoforms, the protease resistant forms of PrP that include amyloid, are not toxic on their own. Mice that do not express their own PrP protein (Prn-p0/0) are completely resistant to
the intracerebral injection of even very high doses PrPres43. Equally striking, mice producing a secreted form of PrP, GPI anchor-less PrP, accumulated massive plaque-like amyloid deposits, yet had no clinical manifestations of prion disease 44. Some brain lesions were present, but there was less neurodegeneration associated with these amyloid plaques than with diffuse wild type PrPres deposits. These results were especially significant as transgenic mice had up to 40% more PrPres in comparison to mice with WT PrP44. Using human tissue samples, the Barron laboratory showed that the accumulation of certain forms of PrPres failed to result in spongiform degeneration. Brain extracts from two cases of familial prion disease were used to test the transmission of disease to transgenic mice. One of the samples exhibited PrPres deposits and spongiform change, while the other presented with PrPres deposits and no spongiform change. Brain extract from the patient without spongiform degeneration did not result in disease transmission but elicited PrPres deposition in large multicentric plaques. Therefore, PrPres would appear to be rendered nonpathogenic by its sequestration in amyloid plaques 45.

Nitrated tau interferes with neurotransmissions and the transport of nutrients in the brain.  

Nitration of tau can be mediated by peroxynitrites or by zinc and copper (the latter contribute to the formation of amyloid oligomers).  
When peroxynitrites are scavenged they produce water which is a de-nitrating agent.  As long as peroxynitrites are being scavenged, it does not matter how many neurofibrillary tangles a person has in his or her brain, they will not develop Alzheimer's disease.

"We are a long way from curing Alzheimer's disease.  We should be a short way from partially reversing it.

The problem is that nearly all the research focuses on amyloid (either oligomers or plaques) and on tau tangles.  Neither cause the disease (although amyloid oligomers increase the production of the oxidant hydrogen peroxide and nitrated tau tangles interfere with neurotransmissions and the transport of nutrients in the brain).

The key to Alzheimer's disease is oxidation.  If the body's antioxidant system is still in tact a person can have significant amounts of amyloid and tau tangles in his or her brain and not have Alzheimer's disease.

The most important oxidant in Alzheimer's disease is called peroxynitrite.  Peroxynitrites through oxidation and nitration inhibit the release and synthesis of neuotransmitters involved in short-term memory, sleep, mood, social, recognition, and alertness.  They limit the flow of blood in the brain and the transport of glucose in the brain which can contribute to apathy, wandering, and delusions.  At very high levels they can cause hallucination.  Peroxynitrites prevent the regeneration of neurons in the hippocampus and lead to the death of neurons.

The key to treating Alzheimer's disease is to scavenge peroxynitrites and to reverse part of their oxidative and nitrative damage.  If you do so, you partially reverse Alzheimer's disease.  The best peroxynitrite scavengers are methoxyphenols such as eugenol in rosemary essential oil (and clove, bay laurel, and lemon balm essential oils) via aromatherapy and ferulic acid and syringic acid in panax ginseng.  Here are the the effects of these compounds in people with Alzheimer's disease in clinical trials:

This one preliminary positive result is likely to lead to significantly increased r&amp;d expenditure in the Alzheimer's field.

"I don't quite understand.. Your MIL died and now you're not sure who will be caretaker of your FIL? I'm assuming that's the situation. Until a permanent solution is found, make sure he has constant supervision. A big change like this can be very disturbing. It will be easier on him if you stay in his house. Another option is respite care, which is him staying temporarily in a skilled nursing facility. That could buy you a few weeks until a decision is made.

In the long term, you should contact your county's Office on Aging for resources and services that he might qualify for, as well as places with open beds for respite care. An Elder Care Attorney is a good idea, as well. They can advise you regarding assets, income, qualifying for Medicaid vs. private pay (for in home or nursing home care), power of attorney.

I can't advise you as to where he should be permanently. What I do know is that being a caregiver will take over every aspect of your life. If you WANT to do it, and are ABLE to do it, great. But if you're not, that's okay too. That's no fault of yours, it's just life circumstances. If you want a good view of what life is like as a caregiver, check out the Facebook group ""dementia caregivers support group,"" as it's the best one I've found.

Sorry for your loss.",,,,applesangria,,,1443335264,t5_2r8fp,t3_3mivjz,t3_3mivjz,3,1444606333,0,0,cvfkwh1,Alzheimers,3,,

"In the beginning, I would, especially if he's still in the early or late stages. Thats a judgment call though. It could help alleviate some of his anxiety and discomfort. When he does something strange, you can say ""don't worry dad, it's jut the dementia!"" Explain certain choices to him- ""dad, I'm sorry but after the doctor told us about the dementia, we can't let you drive. It's not safe."" You can also use this time to get his input about his options, while he's in a moment of clarity- ""dad, we want to talk to you. The doctor said you have dementia, and we want to talk about what that means."" If his memory is still a few minutes long, you can try to have a conversation about his wishes/desires for care and treatment. When he progresses farther and gets to the point where he gets upset about that reminder, drop the topic and just live in his reality. If he is like my LO, he will deny adamantly until she is blue in the face that there is an issue. :)  In the earlier stages, they're aware of a loss of function, but psychological coping mechanisms like denial take over. Later, they don't know what they don't know. Their brain is incapable of processing in that way.",,,,applesangria,,,1443377934,t5_2r8fp,t3_3mkq53,t3_3mkq53,5,1444613515,0,0,cvfzzmi,Alzheimers,5,,

"Yes, there are no cures for Alzheimer's disease, but certain phenolic compounds may provide better treatments for the disease than current medications.  Whether coconut oil fits into this category is debatable.

First some of the positive evidence:

If one wished to try coconut oil as a health supplement, virgin (unrefined) coconut oil would be preferable since it contains higher levels of beneficial “polyphenols” (specifically, ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid

Polyphenols in coconut oil could be potentially useful for Alzheimer’s (and other diseases) since they act as antioxidants. Antioxidants help temper the harmful effects of inflammation, e.g., free radical production, which causes so much damage in Alzheimer’s and other diseases involving tissue degeneration.

In summary, in addition to the polyphenols in coconut oil (acting as antioxidants), it is also possible that the ketone bodies (acting as an alternate energy source for the brain) could underlie the positive effects on Alzheimer’s disease reported by some users of coconut oil.

http://www.alzheimersreadingroom.com/2012/07/Alzheimers-Coconut-Oil-Antioxidants.html

The high levels of saturated fats in coconut oil appear to make it an ineffective treatment for those with the Apoe4.

Another question is whether derivations of coconut oil such as the medical food Axona are more effective or just more expensive (I don't know the answer to this question).  This is the study done by the makers of Axona.

http://www.about-axona.com/us/en/cgp/how-axona-could-help/axona-clinical-studies.html

Alzheimer's disease is most likely caused by oxidation and nitration and the best way to treat the disease are with specific antioxidants called methoxyphenols.

One such methoxyphenol is ferulic acid which helps treat behavioral problems in dementia and slows the loss of cognition (or partially reverses it when used with other methoxyphenols).  It can be found not only in coconut oil but also in rice bran oil and Angelica archangelica (feruguard) and panax ginseng (which also contains another methoxyphenol syringic acid).

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3659550/

Another methoxyphenol--eugenol--also may modify the course of Alzheimer's disease.  Eugenol can be found in various essential oils such as rosemary, clove, bay laurel, and lemon balm and can be easily delivered to the brain via aromatherapy.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20377818

The only reason we hear of coconut oil is because Dr. Mary Newport saw some improvement in her husband using it and then relentlessly promoted it.  I try to do the same with aromatherapy and panax ginseng but there are may obstacles, including the following:

Any treatment with plant compounds is considered pseudoscience by many and any evidence to the contrary is dismissed as false, misleading, or insufficient.

If this worked why have not we heard of it before?

What is needed is larger studies on what has already worked in small-scale clinical trials.

"I agree with the other comment here, that she won't remember the new memories.  I would be careful taking her to new places as well, as the disease progresses.  Changes and new areas cause a lot of stress.  Just this past weekend, my father in law spent the weekend at our house, and the change really messed with him (from sleeping in his own home).  He was scared to go to sleep.  

I would do things for her that she really likes to do and take lots of pictures.  I've heard that helps some to look at old pictures with her might help, although the confusion isn't always predictable.  I hope you have many wonderful memories with her!",,,,KatysLifeStory,,,1443386909,t5_2r8fp,t3_3m6fxk,t3_3m6fxk,2,1444616395,0,0,cvg638u,Alzheimers,2,,
"When my FIL worries about ""not contributing to society"" etc then we do remind him that he has a ""memory problem"" but is otherwise healthy, and the ""memory problem"" is not unusual for people who have managed to live as long as he has. He is very aware that he can't remember anything and sometimes thinks he's crazy and should be put away somewhere, so we keep reminding him that no, this is sometimes merely a byproduct of living a long life, and maybe even of head injuries from when he played football before the cushy helmets. He would have a really hard time accepting that he has a disease, but if it's a byproduct of a sports injury or of his military service, he is more accepting of this issue and it eases his mind. I can sometimes even make him laugh by telling him he has CRS (Can't Remember Shit) Disease.

So I agree with /u/too-much-sass, that you should roll with it. If he is mis-remembering something that is of no consequence, just let him be. Correcting him will do nothing but make him feel bad or make him defensive.

If he's worried that something is wrong, then yes by all means talk to him about having already seen a doctor and you and the doctor already know the issues and he's already being taken care of as best as can be. You'll have to feel out how willing he is to accept that he has a disease rather than a byproduct of aging, an athletic injury, etc. and go with whatever seems to give him minimal distress. Most importantly, let him know that you (and he, if he still needs to feel in control) are taking care of things even if he doesn't remember it.",,,,not-rocket-science,,,1443368621,t5_2r8fp,t3_3mkq53,t3_3mkq53,4,1444610821,0,0,cvfuesq,Alzheimers,4,,
