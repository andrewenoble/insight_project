"That is an excellent suggestion, thank you! I have not studied it but I saw one study result that reported that night-fasts of 9 hours is good and 12 hours is better. That's all I remember of that.

I tried fasting many years ago and could not go half a day without getting severe brain fog. By the end of a whole day I would be completely dysfunctional, unable to even stand up. That was before I was diagnosed with hypoglycemia, and I have not tried it again since then.

Before this keto diet, I used to eat many small meals, I would either eat immediately before bed or I would wake up in the middle of the night and need to eat urgently. When I woke up I usually needed to eat urgently. All of that has stopped on this keto diet. I get hungry much less often and it is never urgent. I am getting curious as to how well I would function on a 24-hour fast, but I think I want more than one month on a keto diet to ensure full adaptation before I try that.",false,false,t1_co19o8g,wildcard235,,0,1422283380,t5_2rfqf,t3_2tb7dz,t1_co0ttlu,1,1424383436,0,0,co19o8g,dementia,1,,

"I'm sorry that you and your husband are going through this.  

My mom has Lewy Body Dementia, and went through this phase.  I was accused, each morning of stealing her money and working for the Mafia, or I was an impostor.  And the list went on, every morning.  I think most dementia sufferers go through this phase or one like it, so just know that you are not alone.  As little as that helps.

It's hard, because you and your family may understand logically that it is the disease speaking, not your *real* FIL, but that does not lessen the emotional impact of having a love one say nasty things to you.  My advice won't help much, but here it is:

Look into a support group for your family.  A local Alzheimer's group would be best, and they won't care what the actual dementia diagnoses is. Being able to trade stories about whose family member said the most vile/evil thing last week helps to keep it in perspective.

Bear in mind, that for whatever reason, dementia makes them act the most horrible to the people that they actually care about the most.

You didn't mention what age your kids are... but have them write down their favorite memories of their grandpa, so that they don't all end up replaced by the bad things.

I'm not religious at all, but it really helped me to visualize my real mom as a ""force ghost"" (from Return of the Jedi) who was watching everything that happened, and was aghast and embarrassed about how her body was acting, and would remind me that she never felt that way, it was only the disease speaking.  It sounds stupid, but it helped me remember who my real mom was and draw support from her. 

Again, talk to a support group, they can get you in contact with more resources, and your entire family will need that.  I really feel for your MIL too, she's probably spending a lot of time trying to apologize for her husband's actions and suffering from them as well.

Argh, I wish I had better advice.  It just all sucks so much.

"Thank you for the kind and thoughtful response.

We met with hospice and the palliative care nurse today.  He has opted against the feeding tube in his living will.  My mom and sisters and I felt strongly that he wouldn't want to artificially prolong his life, and made our decisions with that consideration in mind.  That includes discontinuing the IV hydration and letting him choose when he wants to drink.

The IV hydration has the possible complication of his body just rejecting the liquid, which can be uncomfortable for him.  He's going to have nursing care and people trying to feed him, but it's ultimately up to him whether or not he eats or drinks.  If he begins to get dehydrated again, hospice will ask my mother if she wants to put him back on the IV, or if she wants to let it run its course at that time.

The nurse explained that at this stage, it's sort of like having the flu - when you have the flu, you don't really feel like you want to eat (except for your brain telling you that you have to!).  His breathing will slow and he'll sleep more and more, but he won't be in any pain.  If he eats or drinks, because of the muscles not cooperating in his throat, there is the chance that the food or drink could go into his lungs instead of his stomach, and cause an infection or pneumonia.  As part of our discussions, we opted against antibiotics or other drugs that aren't palliative care (i.e. if he gets a UTI from the catheter, he can get antibiotics for it because UTIs are painful).

We've been told that based on their experience and observations, once a patient stops eating and drinking, without a miraculous recovery, it takes them about two weeks to die.

Today was a hard day, in other words.

I know all too well right now how hard this is on your family, and I wish you all the comfort in the world.",false,false,t1_cni0yob,sat0123,,0,1420688533,t5_2rfqf,t3_2rkyky,t1_cnh8iri,1,1424998296,0,0,cni0yob,dementia,1,,

"Hey, I'm really sorry to hear about your father. Mine has the same kind of dementia and he's in the same stage as your own. We're sort of preparing for the situation you have right now.

I don't know if it will go for your situation, but we've chosen not to give my father a feeding tube if the need arises. The reason for this is because if he was in his own mind and able to make decisions for himself, he wouldn't have wanted it anyway. We've made a lot of our decisions for dad based on what he would have wanted while still integrating the best available care for him. It's important to remember that while the person can't speak for themselves, they are still there and we would only be disrespecting the person we knew/know when it comes to making decisions they wouldn't have wanted. 

I don't know how long they can survive without food in a hospice setting, but I imagine the rule of three applies in some way; three weeks without food, three days without water, three minutes without air.

The unfortunate thing about feeding tubes with dementia patients is that they can cause confusion and fear. There's no way to explain that we're trying to help or what is on their body, and it's only natural they would try to remove it.

While recent memories tend to go first, earlier memories as well as speech function are eventually lost. This is an easy way to record those memories. This can also be useful for patients in a nursing home. There are a few studies out that when the staff knows something about their patient, they are more likely to spend time with them. Your app could have a function where the family, Speech Pathologist, nurse, etc. selects 10 pre-recorded stories that the caregivers listen to as they are providing cares to the patient. That can then facilitate conversation. Even if the patient has limited language function, social interaction is very important. It can also be an activity family members participate in when they come and visit. Listen to a story together as told by their loved-one. 

People with ALS typically loose the ability to speak towards the end of the disease. This sounds like an easy way for them to record their life story for their family members. 

This could be super useful for someone who has had a stroke. If the stroke affects a certain part of the brain, it can cause aphasia, loss of language function. While they would have had to already record their stories, an app like this could be really valuable to them. In grad school I participated in a group called ""Tell your Life Story"" where participants made a scrapbook of their lives. They then (in theory) used it to communicate with others and facilitate conversation. With this app, they could continue to tell their grandkids stories about their childhood. 

Other ideas:
-Allow users to upload pictures then record a caption for the picture. 
-Make it so family members can set up the questions beforehand.
-Set a reminder to do one a day. 
-Make the controls SUPER simple and even have the ability to turn on step-by-step instructions (either written or audible)",false,false,t1_cnqh3ui,briecheese1414,,0,1421374960,t5_2rfqf,t3_2shmnk,t3_2shmnk,2,1424851256,0,0,cnqh3ui,dementia,2,,

My mother spent a few years in a nursing home, recovering from a cerebral hemorrhage. She introduced me to some of the other patients there, who received very few visitors and were simply aching for companionship. One by one I started adding them to my visits. My favorite was a 100 year old Albanian woman, who loved to relive how it felt to be a young girl, sweeping the courtyard with her sister, and the boys who gathered outside the door to catch a glimpse of the two of them. Her words made me feel like I was there with them, and the way her face lit up when she talked was simply beautiful.

She went from washing sheep in the river on her family farm, to finding work as a laborer. She was a strong woman, with class and dignity. Towards the end, she had developed dementia and had to live in a nursing home. She too would cry and become frightened, calling my granmother to come bring her home. Eventually she began to lose touch with reality more often than not. She was, in her mind, a 20 year old woman living in Irleand again having amazing adventures. My grandmother would go to see her and ask, ""What did you do today Ma?"", and Mumums would tell her some wonderful story of having seen the priest at his home, or marching in a parade. At first this was heartbreaking, but we realized that if these ""memories"" made her life better, then why not celebrate the things she was ""doing""?

"What about trying a family intervention, similar to what is done with folks who are addicted, to urge them to accept help? Are more family members nearby, or close friends or good neighbors of your parents who would be willing to take part? There are professionals you can hire to lead the intervention so as to keep the loved one from feeling he is being ganged up on. 

Is there a local council on aging in their community? It might be worth giving them a call to see if they have referrals to professionals who can help. If their wills are not in place and/or they have not named either of you as power of attorney and healthcare surrogate and don't have a living will, you really need to see an attorney about getting those in place.

Since your mother has serious health issues, surely she sees a doctor regularly. A doctor can give a little oral test in the office which lets them spot dementia problems. If you have their healthcare proxy you could call your mother's doctor, let him/her know your concerns and the next time she's due for an appt. the test can be given and the doctor can issue a referral to a neurologist. If you don't have the healthcare proxy then write a letter to the doctor (sent registered, return receipt requested), explaining their situation and asking him/her to consider getting your mother in there and giving her the test. You can't make them do anything without the legal document but if it's a caring physician perhaps this will help.

Finally, since this sub doesn't provide a lot of help, you might try these organizations. Some of them have active forums where you can discuss your problems with others in your situation and perhaps find more creative ideas on how to intervene:

"I work full time on a dementia unit in a nursing home; I have witnessed probably a dozen or so people (with moderate to advanced dementia) go through a hip or pelvic fracture. This is anecdotal, of course, YMMV, etc...

About half of them did die within a year. Most of those people were otherwise frail, depressed, and NOT getting appropriate physiotherapy (or nutrition).

That still leave the other HALF who were either motivated or resilient enough to get through it somehow. Some people need to get up and get walking after surgery and cannot be stopped. They keep on trucking for years with only mild progression of their dementia.

The biggest difference between the two groups was pro-active family support. I've seen families have to fight extremely hard to get the proper physiotherapy and after care to make the success stories. It's the people without family who stay belted in wheelchairs and never get the physio to get walking again; then die from the relentless pain of joint contractures.

In the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease there is often a huge insulin resistance problem that crops up after the accumulation of beta-amyloid but before the brain starts to be damaged irreparably. Hypothetically, removing the brain's dependence on that sugar that is impacted by the insulin resistance could offer you some resilience.",false,false,t1_co0eltd,hithazel,,0,1422210001,t5_2rfqf,t3_2tb7dz,t3_2tb7dz,2,1424398187,0,0,co0eltd,dementia,2,,

"I don't have any thoughts on how you'd convince someone to retire if they're impossible to reason with...

The only additional thought I have that might be helpful is about you-

From an outsider's perspective, I feel that I see you recognizing that he can not be reasoned with, yet simultaneously not recognizing that.

I imagine that there's a part of you that hasn't been able yet to accept that things have really, truly come to this very sad situation.  And, part of you is maybe trying to be completely fair, to leave no stone unturned in the effort to find a solution that lets him have a say in what happens next.

Again, from this outsider's perspective, if several doctors, plus all his family have failed to make a dent in his determination to keep working, I'd say there's really no hope that there are any other means to persuade him.

It might help if you focus your own thoughts on the fact that it is the physical condition of his brain that is causing him to be impossible to reason with.

In reality, the situation he's in now, he's no more able to reason well about the pros and cons of things than is a person who was ***born*** with a brain problem.

We all are very much challenged by the fact that this person who ***was*** well able to reason has now lost that ability.

But it ***is*** well and truly lost.

Maybe it helps to think of it this way - If you were responsible for someone who was born with a brain problem that makes it impossible to care for themselves, would you have any problem with doing whatever it takes to keep them (and others) safe?  Sometimes that might mean a lie or two, sometimes it might mean ""Because I said so"" instead of explanations.

It's probably perfectly fair to think now of your father in the same way.

Grandma had a stroke (we think) then several days later fell and broke her hip. Recovering in the hospital after the first surgery there's no doubt she had dementia.

"Disclaimer: all dementia is different, so I'm about to generalize

The app sounds really good as a concept, unfortunately, the reality of dementia is often more sinister. Older memories are fairly easy to remember (mostly), but more recent memories are harder. 

There are a few problems though:

Understanding technology is a mental skill. Dementia also causes the loss of technological understanding.... apps go early, remote controls and stuff in the middle, forks and toilets at the end. Now, a caregiver could still operate an app for the benefit of the person with Dementia... However....

looking, watching, understanding are also skills. There are so many times my Mother in law is thirsty, so she yells ""water"". But she is sitting on her bed, and right beside her on the table is water. So I point at it and say your water is right on the table.. she looks straight at me. So I say ""Look on the table"" and point again.. but still she does not see it. Even if I hold it right in front of her, she looks at the ceiling instead of at the water. While she can sometimes watch very familiar movies, showing her a picture and expecting her to understand is very difficult. A lot of times She will also lie and pretend she understands what you are showing her ""This is you riding a unicorn...""""Oh yeah, I see that"" ""... this is a picture of an apple..."" So her ability to comprehend that is limited. She sees herself in the mirror, and it is a stranger looking back. 

So this is an interesting concept you have here, and it sort of enforces the future of ""cyberbrains"" concept.. but for dementia, it is of limited value. I do appreciate you taking the time to post here, and perhaps for those other forms of dementia it would be more valuable.

"With an irreversible condition like dementia, most doctors will not recommend the use of a feeding tube because it can, in many cases, lead to increased suffering and lengthening of the time a person spends in the most painful part of their illness.
