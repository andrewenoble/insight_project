"Greetings!
I hope I'm not being a pest.

I’m a graduate student from Indiana University of Indianapolis. I’m trying to find people who are caring for loved ones with memory issues (or have in the past 5 years). When I looked at the current apps/tools  available to you, I found that they make a lot of assumptions about what you need. I want to change that. 


I’m hoping that through talking to you for 15-60 minutes, depending on your availability, I could learn more and we could discuss what your ideal technology would do (e.g. let you know what resources are available in your location, whether you would be interested in 5 minute meditation sessions).


If you or someone you know would be able to do this, it would be greatly appreciated! Please consider helping me to create a tool that could better service you and help me understand what technology can do to better serve you.

"A little research will help you know what to expect. I recommend ""The 36 Hour Day"" and Teepa Snow's videos/seminars/handouts. He's very young. In my experience, people with EOA tend to decline faster. Join a group on Facebook called ""dementia caregivers support group.""

If you haven't already, go talk with an Elder Care attorney. It will be very important that you or another responsible party has medical and financial Power of Attorney; and if he's not competent to sign those documents, you'll need to start the Guardianship process. You should try to get his opinion and input about certain things, like if he would prefer to remain at home for the duration of his illness, or if he is open to moving into assisted living and then memory care when necessary (some people are more comfortable with strangers caring for them, rather than family; some are exactly opposite). Get him into a good neurologist and/or geriatric psychiatrist; anti-depressants may help him stay active and positive. 

Try not to judge him about ""giving up on life."" Wouldn't you want to? He knows his brain is deteriorating, and he knows what is coming. I wouldn't be cheerful either. And as far as asking him to do difficult tasks-- please be aware Alzheimer's is about far more than just forgetting. The brain, over time, becomes less capable of what you might consider to be a simple task. Even in the earliest stages, there is cognitive difficulty. Maybe he isn't giving up, but is truly struggling. ",,,,applesangria,,,1457742019,t5_2r8fp,t3_4a0s0w,t3_4a0s0w,3,1460589396,0,0,d0wmhks,Alzheimers,3,,
"This touches on a very big topic. But to be brief:

1. If we know of a credible, published method for combining risks for a given disease, it becomes a genoset in SNPedia.

2. There are additive as well as weighted genetic risk score models (aka polygenic risk scores) that try to estimate risk. The higher the heritability and the lower the number of variants with major impact, the better they do. But in general these models are definitely not ready for prime time.

3. Population studies are the way to go, but they require a lot of people to get enough statistical power to definitely assess interactions. Having data on a lot of variants (for example, from full genome sequencing) is also better than just having the small portion of the genome sampled by current DNA chips.

In summary: don't worry about a bunch of low level risk factors like the ones you mention. ",,,,snpedia,,,1457459558,t5_2r8fp,t3_46d95z,t1_d0s23sg,1,1460514207,0,0,d0s9nzj,Alzheimers,1,,

"I will respond to your comment in bold with a series of excerpts most but not all of which come from links provided previously.  I understand the possibility for observational bias and part of the improvement in cognition may have been due to a person be taken off of certain medications.  Other interventions probably helped as well. Almost all of the following involve aromatherapy.

Knapp’s daughter, Mary Langston, of Greenville, said she has noticed a marked change in the past few weeks in her mother’s attention span and ability to better remember relatives in photographs and scrapbooks.

“It’s been nice. It makes it so much easier to sit down and talk to her. As a child, you can’t imagine your parent’s not being able to remember things. But lately, it’s like she has been reborn,” Langston said. “She doesn’t get upset that she can’t remember things. Her attention span certainly has improved and she enjoys being around people more. Noises aren’t as disturbing for her.”

“I’m a scientist who believes nothing works without evidence; prove it to me,” he said. “I am working with an aromatherapist who believes everything can be cured through scents. I must admit, I’m becoming a believer, because of some of the data.”  David Loy recreational therapist at East Carolina University.

Benjamin Pearce, president of a chain of assisted living homes for people with dementia, puts his hand in a cardboard box, and in a split second has a string of rainbow-colored flowers around his neck. Here he stands in his office on a Monday morning, intense pale blue eyes set in a stern face, now wearing a white dress shirt, a tie — and a lei. “We use this sometimes as a delivery system,” he says, without cracking a smile. In a flash, the Hawaiian garland is back in the box.

The lei is one way Pearce delivers aromatherapy to the elderly residents in his 12 New Jersey facilities. He also instructs his staff to spritz lavender on their pillows and mix six drops with their bathwater. Other natural oils, such as citrus blends and rosemary, are added to humidifiers, massaged into patients’ skin or pumped into the air via diffusers. “I’m the most pragmatic person you’ll ever meet, and I am totally sold on aromatherapy,” Pearce says.

My mother is in the final stages of Alzheimer's and was given a rough estimate of only 6 more months of life back in November. As is very common, her condition can change from day to day but still in a general direction for the worse. She reached the point where, if she was even awake at all, she couldn't communicate anymore and hardly showed the sign of being aware of my presence. I've been using alternative medicine for a few years now to treat my depression, anxiety, and also for general health. I've since discovered the overlooked value of the herb Rosemary and now use it to treat the symptoms of my depression. I've also noticed better clarity of thought along with an improved short term memory. I was able to get the doctor's permission to give this herb to my mother and we figured at least it couldn't hurt. Much to my surprise, there's been a noticable change. There have been quite a few day now where my mom has been more focused and alert than she's been in a long time. I even got some news from one of her nurses who said my mother had a brief conversation with her. Its been at least a year or two since I can remember anything like that. This change has also been noticed by others on the nursing staff as well as her doctor, who is very surprised. Now I'm not suggesting this is any kind of a ""cure"" for Alzheimer's but the improvement in my mother's condition is something to be said about Rosemary and it's given me some more quality time with her that I thought had been thing of the past.........Gary

I've been using aroma therapy (the scents Lane has identified) for the last couple of years and believe it has been a factor in keeping me in the early stages (I was diagnosed about 4 years ago). I sniff the aromas right out of the bottles, too, but only do it in the morning and the evening. But I also follow best practices:

 


Eating a Mediterranean diet (e.g. cooking with olive oil and lots of veggies)

Staying socially active

Vigorous exercise

Taking meds as directed

Nevertheless, Ecumen’s Awakenings project emphasizes nondrug responses. “Medications have a place, but that shouldn’t be the first thing you try,” said Eva Lanigan, director of nursing at the Two Harbors facility.

So the home trained its entire staff (housekeepers, cooks, dining room servers, everyone) in a variety of tools to calm and reassure its 55 residents: exercise, activities, music, massage, aromatherapy. It taught people the kind of conversation known as “redirecting” — listening to elders and responding to them without insisting on facts that those with dementia can’t absorb or won’t recall...

The results startled even the believers, however. Every resident on antipsychotics (about 10) was able to stop taking them, and 30 to 50 percent of those taking antidepressants also did well without them. When drugs still seemed necessary, “we tried to reduce them to the lowest dose possible,” Ms. Lanigan said.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKN3DGxl06o

I will note the improvements in my mother--no more delusions, recognition of place, including her own home, better sense of time, object recognition such as being able to identify a flower as a rose, repetitive memory (numbers, the alphabet, completing phrases, etc.).  Neither her lucidity nor short-term memory improved much but her comfort around people and in different surrounding approved substantially and she was much more alert.  She would eventually die from conditions unconnected to Alzheimer's disease (severe esophagitis and heart failure).

The improvement is only symptomatic in that when it stops the person resorts to baseline (based on communications with several different caregivers and people with dementia).  This treatment does not cure Alzheimer's disease but it does lead to improvements in cognition related to personal orientation.

I appreciate the grudging respect.  If you wish to tell me what you are working on in regards to Alzheimer's treatment I can tell you how likely they are to be successful.

"You are confusing cure with treatment.  I never said Alzheimer's disease can be cured.  I said that there are effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease that improve some aspects of cognition and behavior such that a person has a better quality of life.  Eventually that person dies from something other than Alzheimer's disease.
This is more than a temporary symptomatic effect, it is a permanent improvement that after a certain number of weeks levels off--that is what makes it an effective treatment not a cure.

I will never fully understand that after reading a series of clinical trial and case studies indicating otherwise, people still so tightly hold to their belief that Alzheimer's disease cannot be treated.  Most people see Alzheimer's disease as some kind of unfathomable and irreversible disease for which no treatments will ever be found or will not be found for decades.  Perhaps people have become so inured by one promised breakthrough after another that they cannot accept positive results in human beings.  Mental inertia is indeed the problem.

I have a very personal stake in this fight for Alz. treatments that DO actually work. And I be damned if I will sit back and condone someone making false claims concerning treatments for Alz.

"My heart truly goes out to you and your dad. My mom is 86 and at this point she seems to vacillate between end stage 5 and beginning stage 6. Four years ago, when she was finally diagnosed with Alz., from time to time she would say, ""I wish I would just fall asleep and never wake up."" Mom had 2 sisters that passed with Alz. so she knew what was to come. She is confused much of the time now and her speech is not good, but I know she still feels the same way. I also know when the end comes, my mom, like your mom now, will have no concept of what's happening. At this point, her suffering will have already ended. Yes, when my mom passes, I'm sure it will hurt a great deal, but at the same time I believe I will feel a great deal of relief that she finally got her wish and is suffering no more.

God bless. One day, in the not to distant future, you and your dad will only remember the good times.  ",,,,fitsme2atee,,,1459028765,t5_2r8fp,t3_4c01ib,t3_4c01ib,2,1460899633,0,0,d1ekvj1,Alzheimers,2,,

rs4420638 is in the ApoC1 gene, next door to the ApoE gene. It can be used to predict ApoE allele status since variants in one are usually  co-inherited with variants in the other.

Different publications study different variants and can come up with somewhat different risk scores. In this case, since it's ApoE-based risk, the most robust statistics are likely to come from your ApoE allele combination and not from the ApoC1 proxy.

"In my opinion, it is the kindest thing you can do for your loved one with dementia. How many times should my FIL have to be reminded that his wife, his parents, his friends, everyone he's ever looked up to in the world is dead. Most of the time he thinks he's 19 or 26 or sometimes as old as 50 (he's 86). 

I know how much anguish it caused him when we had to take away his car keys because he was a danger to himself and others. He felt totally emasculated, helpless, angry, and worthless. Never underestimate how much a car and the independence it represents means to a man. When he asks where his car is, what good will it do him to know we took away the keys after a state trooper called us in the middle of the night after pulling over what he thought was a drunk driver, 2 hours away from his home, and spent the rest of the night at a hospital somewhere out in the middle of nowhere while we drove across the state to get him? If we lead him to believe his car is in the shop and that's why we picked him up for lunch, at least he gets to keep his dignity and pride.

He won't remember the truth. He won't remember the lie. 10 minutes later he's asking the very same question, as if for the first time. I was raised to tell the truth, and I usually do. But to tell this man how things really are, is just cruel. 

Having said that, there are times he knows he's old and that he has a bad problem. Those times are fewer and farther between these days, but when he understands his age and is somewhat present and wants to know what's up, we tell him about his memory problem, how it's not uncommon for people who have been on this earth a long time, we talk about where he lives and why, and it's not so hard to realize his parents have been dead for decades because most 86-year-olds don't have living parents.",,,,not-rocket-science,,,1458346133,t5_2r8fp,t3_4b0rzb,t3_4b0rzb,10,1460737271,0,0,d1564jv,Alzheimers,10,,
"I read the summary of the study again, and I better understand their point: amyloid does not spread past a particular part of the brain.

""The amyloid-β protein remains in the vicinity of the operated tissue and does not spread considerably or affect other brain regions. There were also no clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and no characteristic deposits of the tau protein were seen.""

But my more radical contention is that even theoretically if the operation were on the hippocampus, it would not make a difference.  
Indeed, amyloid plaques by absorbing copper and zinc stop the production of hydrogen peroxide that seems to play a critical role in prion disease and in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.
