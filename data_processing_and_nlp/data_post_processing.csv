Alzheimer's is a long slow progression, traditionally hitting people that are older, and it's MANY years of a slow decline unless another health problem comes up. But there's also dementia related to brain conditions (tumor, etc) or cancers, or other diseases. 

Also forgetfulness and occasional odd behavior is also part of getting older. It doesn't always mean the worst. You should start documenting when/what his odd behaviors are. This way if the time comes to consult a dr, you have some examples to back you up. Also, ask other people that may see him when you don't, to tell you about concerning behavior.

It was comical because he no longer knows my name, yet he recognizes me still. I graduate from college in a few months, and it is weird to think he won't be there, but I am so thankful for those little comments that remind me of the funny comments he used to make.

So first off I'm so sorry. My dads 60 (I'm 21) and he is in the final stages of dementia currently. It is so hard hearing a diagnosis, and not knowing what it really means.

Anyhow, dementia varies greatly depending on the type, person, age, etc. Sadly, usually the earlier a person gets it, the more aggressive it is.

My dad ran a multi-million dollar business up until 5 years ago when he was diagnosed. The one piece of advice I have is that you need to pay attention to his decisions a bit more. We found out my dad made some poor purchases and lost the businesses a significant amount of money. It is easy to ignore, but since he is in control of a major company it is something that needs to be considered.

Once again, I'm sorry. I know it's hard and can make you feel so ill equipped. If you have any questions- let me know. We have gone through a lot over the years and any info I can pass on I gladly will!",bubbasblacklist,6,"hey man

I'm a mom, my kid is 24 - As a mom, I'd say your mom would love it if you stay in touch as much as you can, and she probably wouldn't want you to leave school, she'd want to see you getting ahead in your life as much as possible while she's still able.

Skype, smartphone texts &amp; pics, phone calls, emails - There are lots of ways to let her know you're thinking of her, to include her in your life.  Ask her how she's feeling, tell her you're scared and you know she must be scared too, you can comfort each other.  Ask her everything you can think of about her life before you were born, so you'll know.

Lots of times I have to call her by her first name because she thinks she has two kids, not three, and when I call her mom it upsets her. I've managed to emotionally separate the two women (if that makes sense).  It makes it easier for me to deal with her and take care of her. I'm able to make decisions about her care easier when I remove the emotion. For example, she needs a tooth fixed. Dentist wants to crown it.  I told them to pull it.  There is no way my mom could handle the procedure/process of getting a crown.  Do I want to see my mother with a missing tooth? No. Is this the right thing to do for the woman whose care I've been trusted with? Yes, without a doubt.

If your mom wants nothing to do with the man she divorced, how can she expect you to? To me, that seems very unfair. 

These situations are so much more complicated than one can state in six paragraphs, but based on what you've written (that he was an abusive father, that you're estranged) I would say that you do not have any obligation to take care of him. That said, if your conscience tells you that you must do something, then do something. Your involvement can be as little or as much as you'd like it to be.

It doesn't sound like your father is going to be able to go home, which is probably a blessing for you. Since he is mentally unstable, it is better for him to live in a facility than at home where he can be a danger to others. If you have the option of putting him in a nursing home and having the state pay for it, that sounds like a pretty good solution--again, I'm not sure what your circumstances are.

The bottom line is that you are young, you're on your way to building a good life. It doesn't sound like your father took stellar care of you when you were growing up, and I would say you shouldn't feel obligated to be there for him now.

One of the big problems I see with Alzheimer's is that it's hard to know how much the person understands about his own condition, or if he is even aware that he is ill. All we can do is try our best to get ""in the moment"" with them and try to see the world the way they see it, which, from what I can tell, can change from minute to minute as their attention is buffeted about by occurrences great and small. So it's easy for them to misinterpret what's going on. But the misinterpretation may not last very long because the next thing will happen and the world will change again.

Still, I can understand how heartbreaking it must be to have someone you love so much feel bad and apologize for something they didn't actually do. Your dad may have thought for a moment that you were mad at him for his crown coming out, but I'm sure that your overall care and continued reassurances soothed things over at the emotional level, which I think has a more lasting effect than whatever he thought happened.

There's not one answer for everyone as people react differently when they learn of their condition. However, may I suggest that gentle, agreeable persuasion may be a good approach. But don't be in a hurry. There's little that can be done for people living with Alzheimer's and dementia except to be supportive of them. Emotional support being the most important.

It really isn't critical that your dad is officially diagnosed right now. What's important is that he feels your support and is made to feel safe as his world begins to change. His fears and doubts will need to be addressed sympathetically and he'll benefit greatly from your positive, yet understanding support. 

Telling him that he's wrong or mistaken won't help him. In fact, it may even cause him more distress. The best you can do is to accept his misperceptions and allow him to believe whatever it is that he says he believes. If he doesn't get what you're saying, ask him what he thinks you're saying and accept that as the right explanation.

You, or someone, will eventually need to be more involved in his life in order to prevent any serious accident or injury. I hate to say it, but the time will come when he won't be safe to be left alone. He will need close care and attention.

Remember Me wants to provide people with pins with a specific logo that would represent in a discrete way that the person wearing the pin has Alzheimer’s.
We are creating a pin that will allow strangers to know that the person wearing it has Alzheimer’s, while at the same time sparing that person from having to be reminded of it all the time.
This pin also has the potential to save lives. Say a person wearing the pin was walking by himself. In this case a stranger wouldn't have to hesitate and could notify authorities right away and reunite that person with their family.
The logo is bold and noticeable but it is abstract enough that the person wearing it won't feel like they have a sign on them.
PLEASE HELP SPREAD THE WORD. This is the most important part of this campaign. We need people to be able to recognize the symbol so that they can help the people wearing them. People with Alzheimer’s are still people with feelings and emotions. They may have short term memory, but they live in the moment and they like to be social and feel independent.

The feelings of sluggishness/poor memory you're having are worth some discussion with your doctor, even outside of their possible relationship to your other health concerns.

Don't be so hard on yourself.  Dementia is a disease that you have absolutely zero control over.  It is wonderful that you want to be there for your Nana and you should be - but only to the point where it does not destroy your life.  You have a right to live also.  Unless you're the primary caregiver, limit your interaction with her.  Yes, as you stated she was there for you through difficult times for you and you seem to realize and appreciate that which is a lot more than many people would do.  However, that was in the past.  Life is in the present and your life counts just as much as everyone else's and that includes Nana's.

Drive to a remote area (big parking lot), start the engine and remove one fuse (fuse 22 or 26) at a time. If the engine dies, that's the fuse to remove.
Another way is to shut down the engine, remove fuse 21 or 25 and try to start the engine. As long the fuse diagram is somewhat logical, the engine should not start with any of these fuses removed.

Also tactile activities may spur her memories and give her a feeling of accomplishment and self worth--laundry or painting are both good tactile options.

Simplest Noots are Caffeine (coffee) + L-Theanine.  Caffeine stimulates, Theanine is an anxiolytic.

Next step I tried was Acetyl L-Carnitine (ALCAR) and Choline (eggs)  - this forms AcetylCholine, a very important neurochemical.

Thereafter I started to experiment with the Racetams (peptides), and other stims like Modafinil, which worked for me. I tried weed once or twice in my early life and hated the effects.  have not tried mushrooms either.

i have thought about this a lot after watching my grandparents progression through the diseases and considered the fact that my parents and one day i myself may get the disease its pretty fucked up to say this but its only going to get worse there are good days and bad days but my own personal opinion is that in your situation i would utilize these times of relatively lucidity i would go on long vacations together etc share the time you have together now

724,717.153587963,"The best advice I can give you is to tune it out.  A couple of games you can play is to (quietly, in your thoughts) assign points to her threats and terrible comments.  The worse her language, the more points she gets.  There is absolutely no way you can change her behavior, and short of leaving the job, you are going to continue to be exposed to this.  The only thing you can control is how it makes you feel.  I've been working in human services for a couple decades now and I've been called some pretty hilarious things.  I've been in some terrible situations too, and I learned over time to just let it bounce off.  It is tough, so use little tricks to make it easier.
Another trick is to not let yourself feel relief when the job goes easy.  It is MUCH easier to disconnect from a good situation than from a bad one until you get the hang of it.
Finally, write down some of the really awful things she says, and later, with a trusted person, read them.  You will get a bit of sympathy at worst and a huge laugh at best.
Good luck!

733,718.147002315,"&gt; I just hate the thought that I will be forgotten, that I wont get to grow old with him as we expected to.

This is where the selflessness comes in. I have dealt with my husband's illness by focusing completely on him and putting myself on hold. Even when I need a break — to take a walk, to see friends, to get a manicure — my mindset is that I'm doing this to relieve the stress, to keep myself healthy for him. If he forgets me, it won't be that I'm forgotten; it will be that he deeply loved and appreciated me when he was able to, but that he just can't anymore. If I don't grow old with him, well, life goes on and I'll grow old with whomever is left in my life. People do it all the time.

Honestly, when my husband has a serious lapse — when he doesn't remember that he spent the prior week in the hospital — it makes my heart well up with tenderness for him and draws me to hug him for a long time. When, for the hundredth time, he accuses our nephew of stealing the silver, I validate whatever it was that brought him to say such things — not ""No, he didn't steal the silver,"" but ""Well, he was always an ornery one, wasn't he?""

749,726.808113426,"I think you have a legitimate legal problem here.  

You're right that she needs help, but I presume she is legally competent?  My advice would be to have the family talk to a lawyer who specializes in elder care.  He/she will be able to explain the legalities of the situation, including power of attorney or even a guardianship. Best $250.00 you'll spend. It sounds like you need to get her out of your bf's brothers place.  Can you convince him to kick her out?  It's in his interest too.

Take pictures of the cut on her face.  If need be, call an ambulance if the wound worsens or if she becomes unmanageable.  That will force the issue and will result in a report (if she manages to decline a trip to the hospital). The legal situation will be helped if there is a diagnosis from a qualified professional.

I tried this and had tremendous results. Basically, several reports suggested that some Alzheimers symptoms responded positively to anti-imflammatory dietary measures. (I had/have meticulous notes somewhere, but have misplaced them. lol).

It was a standard ketogenic diet - HIPLOC (65-30-5), MCT / Coconut oil, intermittent fasting - and it did wonders. Two 30 minute walks each day. Dropped whatever psycho-therarapeutic drugs I was on (e.g. whatever Glaxo Smith-Klein was awarding kickbacks on that year), and added a statin and an ACE inhibitor.

For 'reasons' I fell off the HIPLOC and went high carb - white rice, potatoes, beer. Right back to crotchety and forgetful.

982,831.313449074,"Many, many more than 2 studies claim this.  Historically There have been two camps in Alzheimer's research. Those who focus on amyloid beta and believe it to be the preeminent pathogenic agent, and those who focus on tau.

The general consensus in the field more recently however, is that both are important in different ways. amyloid beta aggregation and toxicity is believed to be an early event, which triggers downstream processes such as tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation. Tau misregulation is thought to be the more direct cause of axon loss and neuronal death, which leads to the end stage Alzheimer's disease. 

That being said, many studies have shown the ability of amyloid beta to be directly toxic to neurons and to impair the cellular process of memory called Long Term potentiation.

She still loves your father, but every day your father becomes more and more like some bizarre stranger to her, a stranger with some very difficult behavior, and there's no way out for either of them—one is not responsible for his continuing mental changes and the other is not responsible for the terrible grief she feels watching her life partner deteriorate before her eyes.

Unfortunately, most of the help available costs money. Can your mom be persuaded to see a doctor or therapist on a regular basis who might be able to help her with her issues? Have you searched on http://www.alz.org to see if there is a chapter in your location?

Is institutionalizing your father out of the question? Because maybe it's time.

In short, yes, and I'm only 40 currently.  

My mother died from early onset in her mid 50's.  It very likely started somewhere her 40's with memory loss and progressed quickly.  It seemed to have a very noticeable progression of memory loss, once she couldn't hide it anymore (which was when she lost her job for being ""forgetful"" in her late 40's).

Mine has gotten worse as I've gotten older.  I'd always figured it was my seizure medication + cumulative effects of seizures frying my brain long term...but after Mom...I'm not so sure any more.  I've been working in the same field for a long time, and even something common I would talk about every day I sometimes forget.  Even when its explaining ""common"" things, answering the phone or giving out the phone number.  Thankfully we have (generally) understanding clients, and I can pass things off oftentimes as ""not sleeping well"" or ""not enough caffeine Hahaha!"" but I hate sounding so...stupid...to everyone when you forget things.

Its frustrating and scary in the larger picture.  I try not to dwell on it or I'd probably cry ;)  I do think on it though so I can decide what I want to do long or short (?) term.

Some animals, such as dogs and cats, also suffer from cognitive dysfunction.  The following observation about the treatment of canine dysfunction also applies to human beings with Alzheimer's disease.

Decline in cognitive functions that accompany aging in dogs may have a biological basis, and many of the disorders associated with aging in canines may be mitigated through dietary modifications that incorporate specific nutraceuticals. Based on previous research and the results of both laboratory and clinical studies – antioxidants may be one class of nutraceutical that provides benefits to aged dogs. Brains of aged dogs accumulate oxidative damage to proteins and lipids, which may lead to dysfunction of neuronal cells. The production of free radicals and lack of increase in compensatory antioxidant enzymes may lead to detrimental modifications to important macromolecules within neurons. Reducing oxidative damage through food ingredients rich in a broad spectrum of antioxidants significantly improves, or slows the decline of, learning and memory in aged dogs. However, determining all effective compounds and combinations, dosage ranges, as well as when to initiate intervention and long term effects constitute gaps in our current knowledge.

I think that anxiety can be a symptom of dementia, but it sounds as if she may have more anxiety than dementia.  Tell you what, if I went though 90 days worth of Ativan in 60 days, I would be pretty anxious, too.  I would be surprised if she was sleeping much at all, and that can make you even more disassociated from reality.  

If she is able to get more Ativan, would it be possible for you to limit her consumption to a pill a day?  She might need a higher dosage than what she had been taking, because she wasn't taking the prescribed dosage anyway.  Do be aware that Ativan is addictive, and will need to be increased with time to get to same effect.  There may be better anti-anxiety med that she could take, longer-term, without the risk of addiction, but that is her doctor's call.  

Finally, don't take her dementia/anxiety as a sign that you are doing something wrong.  You are a good person for helping her, but you have to treat yourself well in order to be strong enough to take care of her.  Take as good care of yourself as you take of her.

naked im so sorry for your dad its great to have family around to help we have some family around but theyre more fair weather family but im going to try talking to them more i think a lot of them just dont know how to help i will keep an eye out for social activities i think just being around people helps classes could be an option but her cognition is so compromised i doubt she could even dip a paintbrush in a palette or cup still worth looking into thanks i wish you and your dad ll the best

it is way past time to get him on some medication and for your family to lay down some rules for dad number hour depends being the first

you should look into getting power of attorney of him that way you have control of his bank account sorry side chick and medical care

Prion contaminated growth hormone can lead to the formation of amyloid plaques and more importantly to peroxynitrites--the oxidant likely primarily responsible for Alzheimer's disease.  But one would die from the prion disease before this happened.  Moreover, the plaque is likely a protective response because it absorbs the copper which along with peroxynitrites may be responsible for the pernicious alterations in prion disease in the first place.

1326,995.310868056,"OK. I can relate to this. Your grandpa could be my FIL.

First off, there is a great episode on This American Life about this. The man's mother-in-law developed dementia and he utilized his improv skills to go along with her hallucinations and confabulations.

The worst thing you can do is try to correct him and bring him around to your reality. It only causes more confusion and distress. This is really hard for some people, because it requires stepping out of denial about the fact that their loved one is not in the same reality and never will be, again.

Instead of arguing with him, just go along with his stories. A lot of head shaking and saying ""Ahhh. OK. Sure"" is required. Treat him with respect, and not like a child. Comfort him when he is afraid. My FIL had a scenario where he had been trapped out in the desert for days, without food or water. I would feign alarm and tell him that I was sending a rescue team to get him back to civilization. When he talked about getting back to work, I'd redirect him by asking questions about things he had done in the past. He would talk about things he did when he was successful and that seemed to pacify him.

You may feel as though it's dishonest, but he cannot comprehend the truth and being forced to try only results in upset.

They wait for him and return him home and charge my credit card. 
This is not a perfect system and one day it will not be right for us. In reality he has only used it a handful of time and I generally set it up for him. Shortly after implementing it he ""drove"" me to lunch by calling them, it was very sweet and made him feel like he was contributing.

1426,1040.0762037,"The familial genetic mutations are rare and are only found in a few families with mutations in genes called APP or Presenilin. These special cases belong to a separate class of Alzheimer's called ""Familial Alzheimer's"". Most people who develop Alzheimer's do not come from these families, so Alzheimer's is not considered hereditary. 

Alzheimer's, like most chronic diseases, involves ""risk factors"". Risk factors can be genetic or environmental. If you have a genetic risk factor, like a mutation in the TREM2 gene, you are more likely to develop Alzheimer's, but only by a few precentage points. Environmental risk factors also play a huge role. Factors like obesity and poor oral hygiene, combined with genetic susceptibility make someone more likely to develop the disease. Look at Figure 2 in the link below for a little more information.

It may seem simple and logical to you (writing the notes, expecting her to understand that you are there but asleep, etc) but it doesn't mean anything to her. She is most likely looking for some reassurance and is frightened at feeling alone or separated.  That was a great suggestion of inviting her to share your bed for a while - it might make her feel more secure. But when my wife wants to get up, if I try to get her to stay in bed longer, she becomes extremely fidgety and it defeats the purpose.  The diversion tactics often work but I'm guessing that they won't here since she is wanting the security of you.  A consideration would be for you to nap sometime during the day and catch up on your sleep then.  It's a tough situation but a phase that she may move through in a month or so.

Sometimes you can gently correct when they are worrying about something (Where's my car? Oh, it's in the shop right now.) to find an answer they can live with. I realize it's a bit more difficult in your situation since she remembers your dad's passing so well. We lost my MIL 11 years ago, and my FIL doesn't even remember being married at all (after &gt; 50 years of marriage!).

When she asks what you're going to do with the house, ask her what are her wishes. Pose it as *if* she doesn't return home what would she prefer. The answer may or may not be realistic, but just listen.

1543,1079.90859954,"Hi.  I work in a neurology dept.  We have an Alzheimer's prevention clinic.  Part of my job is to read  the medical literature on a daily basis to ensure we stay current.  Large studies show (check out David Bennetts work at Rush Hospital Chicago) that brains of people with genetic predisposition (apoE 4/4) often have normal cognition until death even though they are riddled with amyloid and tau, and people without apoE 4 can have cognitive decline.  Genes may only account for 1/3rd of cases.  The rest is based on modifiable factors (early menopause without estrogen replacement, mid life obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, concussion, depression, standard American diet, lack of exercise).  Near daily strenuous exercise (just get the heart rate up!) and adopting the Mediterranean diet (vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, white meat, 4 tbl olive oil a day, fish 3-4 times a week, way less white bread, way less red meat, coffee, dark chocolate, red wine) can cut your risk by at least 50%.  The way most of us eat leads to a state of chronic inflammation. At your age you have plenty of time to alter your genetic ""destiny"".  Also... Learn a new language, a new skill, a new instrument.

If she's refusing or forgetting to take meds, she does need more/different care-- I think a hospital evaluation and placement is a good step. Don't expect that this is the end of the road, though- many people have a very difficult adjustment to 24/7 care.

Most will be agitated and demand to go home, but framing her stay there as a medical necessity may help. After some time, she might stop asking to go home. 

 The good news is that with UTIs, once the infection has been dealt with, there is often a slight improvement in behavioral issues- the UTI definitely temporarily exacerbates symptoms.

i wont remember her for the disease that tore away at her personality and basic motor skills instead ill remember how she fought it like it was a sore throat still giving those death stares if you accidentally sat on her feet the past number years have been the hardest times for those who saw what had happened to her we had to watch her slowly deteriorate before our eyes its something that ill live with for the rest of my life but i know its not what shell be remembered for
during her last living moments she wasnt around people who silently sat around with nothing to say instead we laughed and shared stories about her and i know thats how would want it not with mourning her death but celebrating her life ",1152

While it pains you greatly, the physical and emotional needs of the rest of the family such as your grandfather, need to be kept in mind.

At least in a home, there are every 2 hour diaper/bathroom checks, frequent med passes to deal with the insomnia, agitation and depression of the residents. Also, usually snack and hydration every two hours too. Is it like a real home? No, but modern society and the ages to which people are now living, makes this type of home care increasingly difficult.

I cannot say for sure how your mom with progress (suddenly or slowly), but It has been my experience, they do not just suddenly fall off the cliff. Most of the people I have seen will start to slowly go down again without any rebounds. 

My mother was diagnosed 3 years ago. At that time, the best we could tell she was at a stage 4. We had her put on the Exelon patch. For the first year on Exelon, I feel as though she teetered back and forth between stage 4 to early stage 5. But, for the past few months, all I have seen is just a slow downward progression. I would say now she is getting close to a late stage five.

&gt;Like so many things we do, to forestall the inevitable, to scratch out every faint hope to spend just one more quality second with our loved ones. Even when the larger calculus of someone's life points to an unhindered end being the best thing for all concerned.

I total agree. I would even go one further and say it is for our own selfishness. We are thinking about ourselves, not our loved one's. From what I have experienced and witness, in my heart, I am starting to believe this is ethically wrong. However, dementia patient's are presently guinea pigs for (hopefully) future medical advancement. But, is this justification?

my mother was diagnosed number years ago at that time the best we could tell she was at a stage number we had her put on the exelon patch for the first year on exelon i feel as though she teetered back and forth between stage number to early stage number but for the past few months all i have seen is just a slow downward progression i would say now she is getting close to a late stage five

gtlike so many things we do to forestall the inevitable to scratch out every faint hope to spend just one more quality second with our loved ones even when the larger calculus of someones life points to an unhindered end being the best thing for all concerned

i total agree i would even go one further and say it is for our own selfishness we are thinking about ourselves not our loved ones from what i have experienced and witness in my heart i am starting to believe this is ethically wrong however dementia patients are presently guinea pigs for hopefully future medical advancement but is this justification

Yes, you can think of it similarly to HIV. Its unlikely that we will ever ""cure"" Alzheimer's disease, similar to cancer, because it is genetic and spontaneously arrises as we age, as opposed to viruses which we can vaccinate against and eliminate completely (like polio).

However, I was recently reading a review article by two of the biggest names in Alzheimer's disease research (Holtzman and Selkoe), and they stated that they believe Alzheimer's will be a treatable disease, much the same as HIV is today, within the next 20 years.

It's a kinder approach than reminding the remaining spouse every.time.they.ask that their wife/husband has passed as the news feels fresh to them every time and brings on grief all over again and again and again... 

As far as requests to ""go home"", many times, when dementia patients are asking to do that, it's not necessarily to the home that they just lived in but it's actually their childhood home.  They know something is wrong and are searching for the place *and the people* (i.e. Mom/Dad) that provided the most comfort to them.

There have been adult kids who actually take their parents back to visit the old homeplace just to have them get upset because the people they want to see there are, of course, long gone.  The picture is incomplete so it provides them only confusion rather than comfort.

If diagnosed, a child will experience quick and progressive mental and physical deterioration over the course of several years — similar to Alzheimer’s disease, hence its nickname of “childhood Alzheimer’s.” Like Alzheimer’s, Niemann-Pick disease type C has no cure and typically leads to death.

As a new in-law this can put you in a awkward situation. The immediately family (husband, children) need to get involved.

Either way can be a very unpleasant experience for everyone involved. But, no matter what it takes, they need to get her to her doctors before she gets hurt.

when your parent wants conrol of all the decision making in their lives but expects you to assume all the responsibilities on those choices when you are completely emotionally drained by a mother who has always been emotionally immature and just keeps wanting to suck you dry when a parent attempts to make you the choosen one because it is easier and more convenient for them when no matter what you do your parent will never be happy and has no consideration for your feelings and only concern for themselves when no matter how many boundaries you put up or distance yourself your parent keeps attempting to dig their talons into your throat in their endless neediness these elderly parents belong in a place that will keep them safe but cared for by strangers who have no emotional attachment to these selfcentered abusive behavioral individuals",1022

1999,1171.49701389,"Every person with dementia is very different. This is the advice I give my family.

Just go with the flow. 

Ignore the meltdowns. If she seems upset, do not try to engage, it may only confuse her or agitate her further. Let someone who is more aware of her behaviors diffuse any issues. Keep conversation simple. BRING PICTURES!! She may or may not recognize you now, but there is a way higher likelihood of her recognizing old pics of you and the family. Looking through a bunch of old photos is sometimes very therapeutic. Socially it is low impact on the brain, and old memories/long established memories linger the longest. Looking through photos also puts less pressure on you to find the right thing to say. Bring a giant stack and describe the happy events in the pictures. No sad pics for obvious reasons. 

Mellow, neutral tones and relaxed body language is a must. Think Zen and you'll be fine. When you make eye contact, smile, not grin, but a warm ""you are safe because we love you"" smile. 

This is usually how I like to describe dementia to help someone understand the demolition derby that is going on in the brain:

Imagine tomorrow you wake up and instead of seeing a familiar world, all the colors are inverted and the objects are inside out. You are anxious, your environment and everyone in it feels somewhat familiar, yet totally alien. You know it is all wrong, and you can't fix it. Now think about how you would want to be approached under those circumstances. ",DoctorFlimFlam,3,"every person with dementia is very different this is the advice i give my family

There are a range of tests though it really depends on what you want to achieve?

Do you want to screen for dementia or do you want to produce memory exercises as they are quite different things. So far there is little in terms of memory exercise apps and the latest evidence is that's only effective media based tools are are those that have an assistant. You would probably be better with an exercise app as that is the biggest predictor of progression.

The traditional cognitive tests also suffer from repetition effects and we rarely retest more than six monthly as there are learning biases.

i did have the idea of producing a game that monitors cognitive performance by asking the person to do tasks  then alert you or your doctor if performance falls problem of stickiness then arises no one plays the game

perhaps your best bet is recreating something like cst a assisted brain training that we prescribe in the memory clinic an app than can be used to assist the practitioner it may help with recording information and making it more accessible to non english speakers",919

About one third of FTD cases are familial.  Page 3.  In this context, ""familial"" means that the patient has genetic mutations in at least one of the known genes associated with expression of the disease.  Page 3.  Those genes include *MAPT*, *progranulin*, and *C9ORF72*.  Pages 7-8.  There might be mutations in other genes, but those are quite rare.  Page 8.  

The remainder of cases are called ""sporadic"" - meaning that they have no known cause.  Page 3.  It doesn't refer to any sporadic timing of symptoms.  

In light of this, FTD doesn't switch from being familial to being sporadic.  It's either genetic (~30% of cases) or not (the rest).  

Like you, I'd like to get the genetic testing.  From what I've learned talking with people in the biz, it appears that the first step is getting the diagnosed patient tested to see what (if any) genes contain mutations.  That way, the later genetic tests on relatives can just focus on those genes, or further genetic tests can be skipped if it's not genetic.

I just want to point out that Alz is not trending towards younger diagnoses at this point to the best of my knowledge. If you have a source on that statement, I'd love to see it.

The # of cases will triple by 2050 because the population is aging, which means that there will be more people over the age of 65 by then than there are now. It has nothing to do with people getting Alz earlier in life. Early onset Alz is most commonly due to genetics and is thus heritable, while late onset is sporadic and age is the greatest risk factor.

It is important to realize that this study was done entirely in a petri dish, using human brain cancer cells from a tumor. These results will hopefully translate into future animal and human studies, but it is still way too early to know.

Most of this paper focused on inflammation in neurons that are artificially forced to produce amyloid beta, the neurotoxin present in Alzheimer's. Interestingly, they conclude the cannabinoid PGD2 is neuroprotective, where previous other studies have concluded the opposite results. This is something they fail to acknowledge or explain in their discussion. They claim that the cannabinoid THC is the most neuroprotective of the cannabinoids, which is an exciting finding, even in an artificial system. Finally, the most exciting result is the demonstration that blocking the RAGE protein is neuroprotective. Currently, there is a large human clinical trial recruiting to determine if anti-RAGE drugs will slow Alzheimer's progression. This paper supports this hypothesis, and we will see the results in the next few years.

""How do you survive this disease with your sanity intact?"" 

Well, I don't think you really do. Going through this has to take some mental, physical, and emotional toll. It just has to. So you just cope as well as you can - which is all you can do. 

The necessities for me:

An intact sense of humor. When you start losing that you need help right away. That is what made me pickup the phone and call a therapist finally.  

An ability to lie. We like to call them ""fiblets"" and that's OK but sometimes you need to pull a whopper out of nowhere.

Due to the dementia he is incapable of realizing he needs to go to bed (I can wake him up from his chair and try to get him to go to bed at 3am and he will insist he isn't tired). I thought having Netflix at the bed would fix this but being asked to move to the bed seems to just set myself up for disappointment.  I make sure I'm around when the timer shuts off and the bed is all set up. He complains that the computer is broken and after a few clicks of the dead mouse I concede that he is right and say but this screen is working and get Netflix to pick up where it left off.

Since he wasn't on lockdown, they really didn't want him taking a walk and falling as a result of the medication.  So about 2 weeks ago, his psychiatric nurse switched him over to risperidone.  Dad is now refusing to take his evening meds (they suspect because he wants to control at least one element in his life), and so he's only getting a half-dose of anything.  We think this is why he's getting so wild.  The plan is to get him to the memory care and put him back on seroquel twice a day.

I lived with my mom and dad for the worst 5 years of her dementia slide. It was horrible, but I think I helped my parents at least some. It wasn't enough. For the 5 years after that, I lived a few blocks away and my dad finally put my mom first part time and then full time in care. I still helped whenever needed.  6 months ago, my dads heart gave out. Now my mom is starting to shut down with the end stage.   
You've got to live your life...you've got young children to enjoy. Don't miss a minute there, where you're really needed.  
I am sorry for your dad and mom and family...but if you're an ocean away or next door, there is not a lot that can help. Just be supportive in your own way. My dad wouldn't dream of putting my mom in full time care until it was just too overwhelming. He sort of had the martyr thing going on. I finally had to let him do his thing and was as supportive as I could be. 
If he's in the UK, I believe they had some progressive programs there. (Dementia friendly societies and non-profit organizations). I worked for the US Alzheimers Assoc. for a while and I studied some of their ideas. So maybe look into help for him from those organizations?

He forgets names, regular words in conversations and it takes him longer to think of what he wants to say when he is speaking. 

I have no idea how to find out if he imagined his diagnosis, (he has other health problems and is disabled) or if he really was diagnosed. I know he thinks that he is protecting us by not telling us, but by the time we find out for sure, it will be too late to help in the way we can now.
